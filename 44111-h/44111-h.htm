<br />GOLD FROM THE SKY</h2>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to say he takes those big, jug-like
things down there empty and
brings them up full?&rdquo; Johnny Thompson, the
boy from Illinois who had travelled far and
seen many strange things, stared at Ballard
Ball, the red-headed boy of the Cumberland
Mountains of Kentucky, with surprise. If the
truth were told, he found himself doubting the
other boy&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>Here he was standing in the grinding room
of an old fashioned mill watching massive
stone wheels grind the corn he had carted from
his cousin&rsquo;s store and at the same time discovering
what promised to be a first class
mystery right down here in the slow old Cumberland
mountains where, he had supposed,
nothing unusual ever happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s down there?&rdquo; He was looking
at the floor of the mill. At the same time he
was hearing a curious sound, a sucking and
hissing that might, he thought, have been the
working of a small steam engine. But of course
there was no steam engine, for there was no
smoke stack and no smoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing down there but water. Some machines
he brought months ago. They&rsquo;re down
there. The water wheel runs them,&rdquo; the other
boy drawled. &ldquo;Of course he wouldn&rsquo;t bring
water up in the jugs and cart them away. Why
should he? There&rsquo;s water everywhere. This
river runs for miles. Besides,&rdquo; his voice
dropped, &ldquo;that stuff he brings up is queer.
It&rsquo;s cold and it smokes. Yes sir, a sort of white
smoke comes off it all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;White smoke,&rdquo; Johnny said slowly. &ldquo;And
it&rsquo;s cold. That&rsquo;s odd!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have thought it was odd!&rdquo; Ballard
gave vent to a low chuckle. &ldquo;I stood with my
leg against one of those jugs&mdash;if that&rsquo;s what
they are&mdash;once and all of a sudden my leg
tingled and went sort of dead. I jumped away
quick, but not quick enough. Three or four
days after that, the skin all peeled off the side
of my leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cooked your leg!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have!&rdquo; Ballard amended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how long&rsquo;s he been doing it?&rdquo; Johnny
asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Almost a year!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A year!&rdquo; Johnny whistled. &ldquo;And you never
asked him what it was he was bringing up nor
how he got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o.&rdquo; The other boy smiled a queer smile.
&ldquo;He pays me for my work here, keeping the
grinding mill going, pays me well and besides&mdash;&rdquo;
He hesitated. &ldquo;Well, you know, we
mountain folks don&rsquo;t like for other people to
ask us too many questions so, naturally, we
don&rsquo;t ask too many ourselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not,&rdquo; he added hastily, &ldquo;that there are not
people round about here who are burning up
to know all about it. There are. But up to
now nary a one of &rsquo;em&rsquo;s learned anything
worth telling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good watchman,&rdquo; Johnny laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sleep here at the mill,&rdquo; the mountain boy
said simply. &ldquo;And the lower part of the mill,
down where he makes that&mdash;that stuff, whatever
it is, is boarded up pretty tight, all two
inch planks, spiked good and plenty. You
see&mdash;&rdquo; Ballard broke off. &ldquo;Wait a little.
There&rsquo;s Aunt Sally Ann Setser out there. She&rsquo;s
got rheumatism, sort of stiff in her joints. I&rsquo;ll
take down her bag of corn to her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>Left to himself, Johnny allowed his eyes to
roam about the place. This was no ordinary
grinding mill. It was much larger. Before the
stranger came with his unusual hissing machinery
or pumps, and his more unusual something
that was produced apparently from water,
or air, or just nothing at all, it had been
used in other ways. He remembered hearing
Cousin Bill say it had been a sawmill, that
logs had been floated down to it in the spring
when the water was high. But now there were
no more logs and no sawmill.</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s eyes strayed through the open
door and up to the crest of the rocky ridge
known as Stone Mountain. &ldquo;Worth exploring,&rdquo;
he told himself. &ldquo;Caves up there I&rsquo;ve
heard,&mdash;and bears. Sometimes the natives hunt
them. Boy! Fellow&rsquo;d have to watch out!&rdquo;
Johnny heaved a sigh of contentment. He
loved these slow-going mountain people, loved
the mountains as well. In the spring when all
the little streams, and the big ones too, went
rushing and roaring by, when the birds sang
to the tune of those rushing waters and white
dogwood blossoms lay like snow banks against
the hills, that was wonderful!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>In the autumn when leaves turned to red
and gold, when chestnut burs were opening
and the coon hunter&rsquo;s dogs bayed from the
hills, that was grand too.</p>
<p>Yes, Johnny liked it all. But this mystery of
the old mill promised to make his stay doubly
interesting. &ldquo;Just think of an old man coming
down into these hills and setting up a mill for
creating something of real value out of water
and air,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Gold from the sky,
almost. But I&rsquo;m going to find out about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again his thoughts swung back to
mountain scenes. His cousin Bill, who was a
young man with a family, had moved down
here and set up a small store. Bill was doing
very well. Johnny was always welcome. He
clerked in the store, made trips like this to the
mill and helped in every way he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody told me there was a cave up
there along the ridge,&rdquo; he said to Ballard, as
the boy came shuffling back into the mill room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep. There is. Regular good one!&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;Lot of these white icicles in it. Look
like icicles but not really icicles you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stalactites and stalagmites,&rdquo; Johnny suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That what you call &rsquo;em?&rdquo; Ballard stared.
&ldquo;Looks like there might be an easier name to
say. But they&rsquo;re there anyway. Want to go
up there? Don&rsquo;t have to go back right away
do you? I&rsquo;ll be through in less than an hour.
Then we&rsquo;ll go up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;ll,&rdquo; Johnny reflected for a moment.
&ldquo;Just so I get back by early candle light. I
guess it will be all right.&rdquo; Just at that moment
had there been any mountain imps about, and
if there were such creatures as imps, we might
imagine one whispering to Johnny: &ldquo;As if
you&rsquo;d ever get back by early candle light!&rdquo;
But there are no imps, so there was no whisper.</p>
<p>As Johnny stood there a feeling of uneasiness,
not to say of guilt, crept over him. At
first he was at a loss to know what it was all
about. Then, like a sudden bang from a squirrel
hunter&rsquo;s gun, it came to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ran away!&rdquo; he exclaimed in an undertone.
&ldquo;Ran away. That&rsquo;s what I did.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>Yes, that was just what he had done. The
call of the Cumberlands had been too much for
him. The whisper of breezes among the hilltops,
the chatter of squirrels in the chestnut
trees, the gleam of water in deep pools where
sly old black bass lurk, had been too strong
for him. He had run away.</p>
<p>Run away from what? The strangest thing!
Not from his home. Johnny had no home except
the home of his grandfather at old Hillcrest.
There he was free to come and go as he
chose. He had not run away from his job
either, at present he had no job. He had run
away from a promise.</p>
<p>In Hillcrest, the little home city of his grandfather,
there was a college, not a large college,
but a very fine one. The students were a sturdy
hard-working lot, the professors wise and
friendly.</p>
<p>No, Johnny had not promised to attend college.
&ldquo;College is fine for some people,&rdquo; Johnny
had said. &ldquo;Fine for a lot of fellows, but not
for me. Imagine me sitting still for a whole
hour listening to a lecture on Plato or the fifth
nerve of a frog. Some people are born for action.
That&rsquo;s me. I can&rsquo;t sit still.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>Action. Yes, that was the word, and it was
action Johnny had promised. He had told
Coach Dizney that he would get out and scout
around among the nearby small cities for good
football material. The coach had a good team&mdash;almost.
He was short two or three good
players. More than all else he needed a left
half-back. Johnny had promised to find him
that particular player.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I failed!&rdquo; Johnny groaned.</p>
<p>So he had. Johnny did not play football. He
was handicapped by a bad knee that doubled
up under him as soon as he ran fifty yards. But
Johnny knew a good player when he saw one.
Johnny was a lightweight boxer of no mean
reputation. He could put a man through a series
of action that told him very quickly what
he would be worth behind the line of scrimmage.
Even Coach Dizney admitted that it
was uncanny the way Johnny picked them. He
had sent Johnny out to scout, then had hurried
away for a vacation in the north woods. Johnny
had scouted faithfully for two weeks with
no results worthy of mention. Then the call
of the mountains had got him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I failed him,&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;Failed the good
old coach.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>He was full of self reproach but the lure of
the hills held him. Oh well, there were still
two full weeks before college opened. He&rsquo;d
have a breathing spell here in the Cumberlands.
Then he&rsquo;d go back and pick &rsquo;em. Oh!
Wouldn&rsquo;t he though?</p>
<p>A half hour later all guilty thoughts were
banished by Ballard&rsquo;s cheerful drawl: &ldquo;All
right now, we can go. Buck Howard&rsquo;s here.
He&rsquo;ll tend the mill. Your corn will all be
ground by the time we get back.&rdquo; These mountain
mills, like the mills of the gods, grind slow
but they grind exceeding fine. Cousin Bill
made a nice profit by trading &ldquo;brought on&rdquo;
groceries, sugar, baking-powder, and spices
for corn. He had the corn ground at this mill
then shipped it out to special customers who
liked this fine ground corn meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s little Bex Brice,&rdquo; Ballard said. &ldquo;He
wants to go along. Real name&rsquo;s Bexter, but we
call him Bex. Old as I am, Bex is, but you forgot
to grow, didn&rsquo;t you Bex?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The short, sturdy-looking, freckled faced
boy grinned and said, &ldquo;I reckon.&rdquo; Then they
were away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you know every rock up here,&rdquo;
said Johnny, as they went scrambling up and
up, over an all but perpendicular trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mebby I do,&rdquo; Ballard admitted. &ldquo;But Bex
knows &rsquo;em better. He&rsquo;s a regular mountain
goat, Bex is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saw a bear up here day before yesterday,&rdquo;
Bex put in eagerly. &ldquo;Regular big one. Scared
me half to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure nuf?&rdquo; Ballard paused to stare. &ldquo;Must
have come over the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without quite forgetting the bear, they
struggled on up the rocky slope. Johnny was
thinking, &ldquo;Suppose we get back into the cave
and the bear comes after us?&rdquo; He did not quite
know the answer to this. To ask, however,
might be showing what these folks called &ldquo;the
white feather,&rdquo; so he did not ask.</p>
<p>Instead he began wondering again what
that old man could produce down there beneath
the mill, out of water and air. &ldquo;He takes
nothing down but brings something up.&rdquo; Here
indeed was a puzzler. &ldquo;If he took some of the
corn down there you might think he was making
moonshine whisky,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;And&mdash;and perhaps he does when Ballard is
asleep. And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>Someone had told him that this old man,
Malcomb MacQueen, had a noble character,
that he had helped bring well educated teachers
down to the school at the fork of the river.
&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t do that and then go peddling poisonous
moonshine,&rdquo; Johnny thought. There
had been men who did good deeds to cover up
the evil that was hidden in their hearts. But
somehow, he had a feeling that moonshine was
not the answer. &ldquo;What can it be?&rdquo; he asked
himself. Johnny&rsquo;s reflections were broken in
upon by a word from Ballard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he whispered, as seizing Johnny&rsquo;s
arm he brought him to a sudden halt.</p>
<p>To Johnny&rsquo;s keen ears came a faint, high
keyed sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pig, a young pig! He&rsquo;s squealing.
Something&rsquo;s got him!&rdquo; It was Bex who whispered
this excitedly.</p>
<p>For one full minute the three boys stood
there, breathing softly, silently listening. Then
Ballard murmured low, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming this
way. We&mdash;we&rsquo;d better hide.&rdquo; His eyes, searching
the ridge above, spied a cluster of beech
trees clinging to the rocks. &ldquo;Up! Up there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>Next instant, without a sound they were
scrambling from rock to rock on their way up.
Just as they reached the cluster of trees, Ballard&rsquo;s
foot loosened a rock that went bumping
and bounding downward to make at last one
wide leap and land in a narrow meadow far
below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; On Ballard&rsquo;s face was a look of consternation.</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s lips formed one word: &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been hog stealin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Ballard whispered.
&ldquo;Uncle Mose Short has lost three. Lige
Field lost two. If we catch the thief it will just
naturally be something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some little time after that there was
silence. From time to time, ever a little louder,
there came the frantic appeal of the pig.</p>
<p>Then, quite suddenly, a fresh sound burst
upon their ears. A blue and white airplane
came swooping across the ridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to Frankfort,&rdquo; Johnny suggested,
&ldquo;or Louisville.&rdquo; To him the soaring plane was
not a novel sight. To the mountain boys, it
was an object of wonder. Even Johnny was
surprised and a little startled when the plane,
instead of streaking across the sky, circled
twice then, like some lone, wild duck, came to
rest on the narrow meadow far below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Motor trouble forced him to land, perhaps,&rdquo;
Johnny whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon we can&rsquo;t hardly be sure of that,&rdquo;
was Ballard&rsquo;s surprising reply. &ldquo;Judge Middleton
rented that meadow to a stranger. When
he asked him what he meant to do with it he
said he wasn&rsquo;t prepared to say. Mebby he&rsquo;s
just got it for his airplane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy! Oh, boy!&rdquo; Bex whispered excitedly.
&ldquo;I sure do hope so! I&rsquo;ve always wanted to see
one of them things right close up. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; Ballard put a hand over the small
boy&rsquo;s mouth. There was scarcely need for
this. At that moment from very close at hand,
there came the heart-rending cry of a baby pig
in mortal terror. And, before one of the boys
could move or breathe, along the trail, below
them and all too close, there came the hugest
bear they had ever seen. And closely gripped
between his gleaming teeth was the hopeless
porker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&mdash;there&rsquo;s your hog thief,&rdquo; Johnny
whispered low, as the bear vanished round a
boulder. &ldquo;What you going to do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;not a thing,&rdquo; Ballard stammered.
Whereupon the three boys, seized with a nervous
desire to laugh, all but burst their sides
holding in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>In the midst of this, Ballard sobered with a
suddenness that was startling. With a shaky
finger he pointed as he hissed: &ldquo;Look! Just
look down there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other boys looked, then stared. Almost
directly beneath them was a narrow, swinging
bridge across a rocky chasm. It was a foot
bridge made of boards and light cables. Ballard
had crossed this bridge hundreds of times,
but always on foot. Never had he seen horse
or mule attempt to cross it. But at this moment,
as they stared, expecting instant catastrophe,
they saw, standing at the very center
of the old and fragile bridge, a huge, black
mule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sambo,&rdquo; Ballard said hoarsely. &ldquo;Uncle
Mose Short&rsquo;s Sambo! Poor old Uncle Mose!
His mule will never make it. The cables are
sure to break. The mule will be killed. It&rsquo;s
the only mule Mose ever had, or ever will have.
Wonder what made him try to cross?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got untied somehow,&rdquo; Bex suggested.
&ldquo;Went out hunting for Mose. We got to do
something. We really must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at that moment, the small pig gave an
unearthly squeal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The bear!&rdquo; Ballard whispered in an awed
tone. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s up there ahead of us on the trail
somewhere. There&rsquo;s no way to get down to
the bridge but to go right up ahead there
where the bear went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny rose. He wanted to go but something
seemed to hold him back. He knew
Uncle Mose, the oldest mountaineer of that
region, knew and loved him. Uncle Mose was
a famous cook. He could make the most marvelous
stewed chickens and dumplings. Uncle
Mose&rsquo;s mule should be saved somehow. But
how?</p>
<p>Just then Ballard spoke. &ldquo;Look! There&rsquo;s
someone coming from the other way! Why!
It&rsquo;s Mr. MacQueen! The man that owns our
mill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny stared. So that was the man! The
man who went down into that mysterious
lower portion of the ancient mill. &ldquo;He takes
down empty jugs and brings them back up
full,&rdquo; he whispered to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Malcomb MacQueen, that&rsquo;s his name,&rdquo;
Ballard said as if he had read Johnny&rsquo;s
thoughts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>This small, gray haired man with a quick
nervous stride had appeared around a bend. At
sight of the mule on the bridge, he stopped and
stared. He stood there for ten seconds only.
Then he sprang forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Ballard was on his feet, ready to
slide down the slope to the trail and to follow
that trail, to face the bear and fight him if he
must. &ldquo;Look! Mr. MacQueen is going on the
bridge! And he must not! Must not! The
cables won&rsquo;t hold another pound. One side is
half rusted away. Come on! Come on! Come
quick!&rdquo; Slipping and sliding, he led the way
down the steep slope to the trail below.</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s mind was in a whirl. &ldquo;The bear,
the bridge, the mule, Malcomb MacQueen,&rdquo; he
thought over and over. For all that, he followed
Ballard as closely as he dared.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, at that moment, like a
sudden burst of light, his duty to Hillcrest
College and the coach stood out before him.
If he went down there when would he come
back? Somehow he felt himself being drawn
from the path of duty. And yet, when approaching
tragedy calls, one must obey that
call.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br />THE BRIDGE FALLS</h2>
<p>The moments that followed were the wildest
ever experienced by the young trio,
Johnny, Ballard, and Bex. Casting aside all
caution, they went gliding down the rocky
mountainside at a perilous speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; Ballard cried. &ldquo;We gotta&rsquo; stop
him, save him. He&rsquo;s the best man that
ever lived. He&rsquo;s fed folks when they were
nearly starving. He put our school back where
it&rsquo;s fine. He&mdash;he&rsquo;s helped hundreds of people.
Now if the bridge breaks&mdash;if he goes down&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not finish. His feet came down hard
on the narrow trail. This brought back to his
mind with the force of a blow, the realization
that but a moment before, a huge bear had
gone up that trail. The bear carried a half-grown
pig in his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t dare molest a dog when he&rsquo;s eating,&rdquo;
he whispered to his companions. &ldquo;No
more do you dare interfere with a bear. But
we gotta&rsquo; go that way. Have to be sly and cautious,
that&rsquo;s all. Not a word now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>Next instant, on tiptoe but with utmost
speed, he was away.</p>
<p>Johnny caught his breath, then followed.
Little Bex brought up the rear. Now they
rounded a huge boulder. Was the bear there?
No. A clump of pines lay straight ahead. Behind
those, waiting, ready to roar and spring
perhaps?</p>
<p>Strangely enough, though he moved forward
silently, Ballard was not thinking of the
bear. He was thinking instead, of the little
drama, that like a moving picture, was being
played out beneath them. The swaying bridge,
the mule, the gray haired benefactor of a whole
community, all played a part in the drama, that
for the time, was hidden from their view.
What was happening? Would the man go on
the bridge in an attempt to save the mule?
Mr. MacQueen loved Uncle Mose, indeed he
loved every one. That mule was Uncle Mose&rsquo;s
chief treasure. Without him, he could not earn
a living. If the gray haired man went on the
bridge, would it break? And if it did? Ballard
could not bear to think. And all the time he
was speeding forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>Soon he would be at a point where once
more he could look down and see that bridge.
From this point, by following a trail that was
little more than a chance to slide over the
rocks, he could hope to reach the bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But first the bear,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I must be
careful. I must&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke short off. Just at that moment, a
mountain of dark, brown fur, went rolling
away from him to disappear through a dark
hole that led into the side of the mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cave!&rdquo; Ballard panted. &ldquo;I forgot all
about it! He&rsquo;s gone in there. We&rsquo;re safe. But
come on. Come on quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One moment more and they were looking
down on the bridge. The mule was still there.
It seemed more than probable that his fat sides
had stuck between the wires along each side
of the bridge, that he could neither go ahead
nor turn back. This, the boys will never know
for certain.</p>
<p>Their eyes did not linger long on the mule
for there, stepping boldly out on the slightly
swaying bridge, that even seen from above appeared
to shudder, was the mysterious, little
gray haired man, Malcomb MacQueen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go back! Go back!&rdquo; Ballard shouted these
words. But the wind was against him. The
aged man was slightly deaf. Apparently he
did not hear for he walked straight on.</p>
<p>The three boys stood aghast, watching.
Now he was ten feet from the solid rock he
had left, now twenty, now thirty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m going down there,&rdquo; Bex muttered
hoarsely. Next instant like a miniature landslide,
he went plunging down the perilous
slope.</p>
<p>Cupping his hands, Ballard shouted once
again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back! Mr. MacQueen! Go back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time, his voice, sharpened with an edge
of despair, carried far. The man on the bridge
paused. He looked up. Ballard heaved a sigh
of relief. &ldquo;Surely now he will turn back,&rdquo; he
told himself.</p>
<p>But apparently he had not been understood
for the old man merely waved a hand, then
went on, a step, two, three steps,&mdash;while the
ancient, rusty bridge shuddered and swayed
more and more.</p>
<p>Then, when all hope seemed gone, a miracle
appeared to have happened. Bex who, mere
seconds before, had stood beside the boys, appeared
at the end of the bridge beneath them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. MacQueen!&rdquo; he screamed, &ldquo;go back!
The bridge is not safe. Too much weight. It
will break. Go back! Go back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sambo,&rdquo; was the astonishing reply.
&ldquo;What could Uncle Mose do without Sambo?&rdquo;
He took one more step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. MacQueen go&mdash;&rdquo; Bex did not finish
for at that instant the thing happened. Something
like a pistol shot rang out, the breaking
of one cable. For ten terrible seconds, while
the man clung to wires and the mule hung
trapped in midair, the other cable held. And
then, with a sickening swirl, the bridge went
crashing down and over until it struck the
rocky wall below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come&mdash;come on,&rdquo; Ballard breathed hoarsely.
&ldquo;We got&mdash;gotta&rsquo; go down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just how they went down that rocky wall,
Johnny will never know. Now he found himself
hanging by his hands to a ledge feeling
with his toes for a foothold, now racing along
a shelving bit of rock where a slip meant disaster
and now, gripping the root of a gnarled
and twisted tree, he fairly threw himself into
the waiting arms of an evergreen below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>A short, brief, breath-taking struggle, it
was. Bruised and scratched but with no serious
injuries, they reached the bottom at last.</p>
<p>To their vast surprise, as they neared the
wreck of the bridge, some huge creature
reared himself on high, uttered a startling &ldquo;he-haw-he-haw,&rdquo;
and went clattering away over
the dry bed of the ravine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sambo!&rdquo; Johnny said in an awed whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t kill a mule,&rdquo; Ballard muttered.
&ldquo;He should have known that.&rdquo; He pointed at a
crumpled heap of gray on the ground. That
heap was Malcomb MacQueen.</p>
<p>With aching heart, the mountain boy bent
over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s unconscious, but he&rsquo;s breathing,&rdquo; he
said slowly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get him out of here.
It&rsquo;s less than a half mile to the end of the run.
Then there&rsquo;s a meadow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And an airplane,&rdquo; Johnny replied hopefully.
&ldquo;Remember? That plane landed there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; A look of hope came to Ballard&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;Do you suppose he&mdash;but we&rsquo;ll
have to have some way to carry him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s strong arms were tearing
away at a short section of the broken suspension
bridge. &ldquo;Here I&rsquo;ll tear this off. Break
those wires. There, there you are! Now. Just
lift him up. Gently! Gently!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The groans of the aged man, as he was
moved, brought tears to Ballard&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, Johnny was thinking.
&ldquo;He made something out of nothing, sold it
and used the money to help others, took gold
from the sky, you might say. This man did
that.&rdquo; Little did he dream that his words &ldquo;took
gold from the sky&rdquo; were almost literally true.</p>
<p>But there was no time for wandering
thoughts. There was need now for strength,
speed and wisdom. The bed of the dry stream
over which they must travel was boulder-strewn
and rough.</p>
<p>Strong arms and willing hearts enabled
them to accomplish the difficult task. Just as
the stranger in his airplane was warming up
his motor for a take-off, he saw two boys come
out on the end of the meadow. They were carrying
something. He guessed it might be an
injured person. They put down their burden
and waved frantically. Shutting off his motor,
he hurried toward them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; he demanded when he
came racing up to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bridge! The&mdash;mule,&rdquo; little Bexter
stammered. &ldquo;He&mdash;he fell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Johnny explained more coherently.
&ldquo;The suspension bridge fell when he was
on it. We&mdash;we&rsquo;re afraid he&rsquo;s badly hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look him over.&rdquo; The aviator was
young, brisk and business-like. His slim fingers
moved rapidly over the silent form. &ldquo;Leg
broken, that&rsquo;s sure,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Bump on
the head, not too bad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get him to a doctor at once.&rdquo;
His voice took on a note of command.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the nearest doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Gap, fifteen miles away!&rdquo; Ballard&rsquo;s
tone told his despair. &ldquo;Wagon road, all rocks.
Take hours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s out!&rdquo; the aviator decided instantly.
&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said to Johnny. &ldquo;Lift him up.
I&rsquo;ll take this end, now! March!&rdquo; He led the
way toward the airplane on the double-quick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got blankets. Make him a litter on the
floor of my airplane cabin. We&rsquo;ll have him at a
city hospital in short notice,&rdquo; the aviator said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take him by air?&rdquo; Ballard stared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tha&mdash;that,&rdquo; Ballard replied huskily, &ldquo;will
be noble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; the pilot said ten minutes later.
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going along to look after him? Two
of you if possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I. How I&rsquo;d like to!&rdquo; Ballard was near
to tears. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;d want me to stay with the
mill. It&mdash;it might be terribly important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right you other two!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Bexter gulped. He turned first red
then white. It was evident that he had never
ridden in a plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; Johnny said quietly. &ldquo;Be glad to.&rdquo;
An airplane was nothing new to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; little Bexter breathed. &ldquo;Bal&mdash;Ballard,&rdquo;
he caught his breath sharply, &ldquo;you&mdash;you
tell my folks I might not come back nev&mdash;never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh come now, sonny!&rdquo; the aviator exclaimed.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not half as bad as that. Tell his
mother he&rsquo;ll be home for breakfast. Hot cakes
and molasses. Hey, son?&rdquo; He gave Bexter an
assuring slap on the back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>Two minutes later they were in the air, all
of them but Ballard. Skimming along over the
narrow meadow, they rose higher and higher
until the whole beautiful panorama of the Blue
Ridge&mdash;Big Black Mountain, Little Black, Pine
Ridge, and all the rest, lay spread out beneath
them.</p>
<p>Little Bexter drew in a long, deep, breath,
then shouted in Johnny&rsquo;s ear: &ldquo;I never
dreamed it could be like this. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off. A pair of keen, gray eyes,
were studying his face. Malcomb MacQueen
had apparently regained consciousness.</p>
<p>Johnny too saw those eyes and liked them.
&ldquo;Keen eyes,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;He knows a great
deal. Hope I can get to be his friend.&rdquo; Then
again came that haunting question: &ldquo;How
could this man go down into a mysterious
space beneath a grist mill and by setting some
sort of machinery in motion, produce something
very valuable out of nothing but air and
water?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he will tell me,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;But
at least, not now.&rdquo; He saw those gray eyes
close, whether in unconsciousness or sleep, he
could not tell. Sleep under such unusual circumstances
appeared impossible, but this, he
realized was a remarkable man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>It seemed to Johnny that the time consumed
in that journey was remarkably short. To his
utter surprise, he found himself circling over
the roofs and chimneys of a sizeable city. Next
moment, with a speed that was startling, they
were shooting downward for a landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Qui&mdash;quick trip,&rdquo; he said to the pilot a moment
later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been quicker if my new motor were complete!&rdquo;
was the mysterious pilot&rsquo;s strange reply.</p>
<p>But here were officers, doctors, an ambulance,
all ordered in advance by two-way airplane
radio. The little gray haired man was
lifted out tenderly, then whisked away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You making a new kind of motor?&rdquo; Johnny
asked the pilot when everyone had departed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Motor&rsquo;s not as new as the fuel I&rsquo;ll use,&rdquo; was
the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of fuel?&rdquo; Johnny ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be surprised!&rdquo; The pilot looked
away. &ldquo;More foot pounds of energy for its
weight than any yet discovered. Go around
the world in non-stop flight&mdash;perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; Johnny breathed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say! I&rsquo;m starved!&rdquo; the pilot exclaimed.
&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;ve done all we can for your friend,
at least for the present. Want something to
eat, you boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did they? Little Bexter grinned from ear to
ear.</p>
<p>Early next morning they found themselves
once more standing beside the airplane. A boy
about Johnny&rsquo;s age had just arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Donald Day, Malcomb MacQueen&rsquo;s
grandson,&rdquo; he introduced himself. &ldquo;I want to
thank you for looking after my grandfather,&rdquo;
he said to Johnny and Bexter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how is he?&rdquo; Little Bexter&rsquo;s words
stuck in his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s pretty badly busted up!&rdquo; Donald Day
wrinkled his brow. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s tough. He&rsquo;s always
lived right. The doctors say he will pull
through but it will take a long time. And during
that time,&rdquo; he squared his shoulders, &ldquo;during
that time I&rsquo;m to carry on his work.&rdquo; He
jingled a bunch of keys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In&mdash;down there in that space beneath the
mill?&rdquo; Johnny breathed.</p>
<p>The other boy shot him a quick look. &ldquo;Yes.
Down there,&rdquo; he replied quietly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>A hundred questions were pressing in Johnny&rsquo;s
mind demanding an answer. He asked
none of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right boys,&rdquo; said the pilot. &ldquo;I promised
to have this little fellow home for breakfast.&rdquo;
He touched Bexter&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;So guess we
better step on the gas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Johnny thought. &ldquo;Same old gas. But
what fuel could he have been speaking of yesterday?
A fresh mystery. I&rsquo;m sure going to
solve that one too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as the big man-made bird took to the
air, he thought once more of his promise to the
coach. &ldquo;Told him I&rsquo;d find him a real half-back,&rdquo;
he thought for the hundredth time. &ldquo;Be
strange if I found him right down here in the
mountains. But then, of course I won&rsquo;t. Oh
well, I&rsquo;ll have a day or two of fishing. After
that I&rsquo;ll go back on the hunt for a half-back.
Pray for luck, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br />WITH THE AID OF NICODEMUS</h2>
<p>Anyone witnessing the return of little
Bexter to his home that morning might
well have supposed that he had made at least
two non-stop flights round the world, instead
of one short trip to Louisville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Bex! Y&rsquo;er back!&rdquo; his small brother exclaimed.
&ldquo;You bin way up in the air! You bin
all the way to Louisville!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I reckon,&rdquo; Bex&rsquo;s eyes were on his
mother. She said never a word. Her face was
a mask. &ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; Ballard whispered,
&ldquo;she&rsquo;s dabbing at her eyes when we don&rsquo;t
look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great moment for Bex&rsquo;s folks,&rdquo; Johnny
smiled a happy smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we got him
back safe. They&rsquo;ll never forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you all just draw up chairs and take
yourself some pancakes,&rdquo; Bex&rsquo;s mother invited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorgum!&rdquo; Ballard whispered to Johnny.
&ldquo;Sorgum molasses on real buckwheat pancakes.
Yum! Yum! You can&rsquo;t beat &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>Nor can you. Johnny Thompson and Donald
Day found this out soon enough. This mountain
cabin was small. The kitchen was the
smallest of its three rooms, but shone upon by
the good mountain woman&rsquo;s gleaming face,
and warmed by her glowing hospitality, it became
for those four hungry boys the largest,
most gorgeous room in all the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorgum,&rdquo; Ballard murmured blissfully a
half hour later. &ldquo;Sorgum molasses and buckwheat
pancakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take yourself another helping,&rdquo; said Bex&rsquo;s
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Ballard&rsquo;s eyes rolled as he patted
his stomach. &ldquo;And I got to be going. I
came away from the mill just to bring Bex
home. Now I must go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mill, Johnny thought with a start. Oh
yes, that mysterious mill. Perhaps Donald Day
will show me its secrets.</p>
<p class="tb">A glorious golden moon hung like a Japanese
lantern over the jagged ridge that is
Stone Mountain when Johnny on the evening
of that same day wended his way toward
Cousin Bill&rsquo;s home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>Although Johnny travelled over a trail that,
winding along the mountainside, went up and
down like a roller coaster, he did not look
down upon rocks and ridges but upon a broad
and fertile field, level as a floor. There are
many such farms to be found in the narrow
valleys of the Cumberland. This particular
farm belonged to Colonel Crider. The Colonel,
Johnny had been told, was rich. Smart racing
horses, sometimes taken to the Kentucky
Derby, contentedly grazed in his rich pastures.
He had a daughter. Just about sixteen years
old, Johnny guessed she was. Johnny had seen
her only once and that at a distance, yet even
at that distance, there was something about
the dancing rhythm of her movement, the tilt
of her head that had suggested a spirit of light
gayety no one could despise.</p>
<p>Johnny was not at this moment thinking of
Jensie Crider. His thoughts were gloomy ones.
Truth was, he was engaged in one of those
mental battles that come to every boy, a fight
between his own desires and what he believes
to be duty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I promised the coach I&rsquo;d find him a real
half-back and I haven&rsquo;t done it,&rdquo; he groaned.
&ldquo;But up there on Pounding Mill Creek there&rsquo;s
a pool where the biggest old black bass is lurking.
I&rsquo;ve seen him twice. I almost had him
once. Now I&rsquo;ve got just the right bait&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment his eye was caught and held
by something moving down there in the Colonel&rsquo;s
back pasture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Nicodemus,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s
got into him? He&rsquo;s scooting across his pen like
mad. Just as if he was after something. And&mdash;and
he is! Or&mdash;or something&rsquo;s after him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came to this decision with a sudden mental
jolt. Nicodemus was the Colonel&rsquo;s favorite
ram. Very highly pedigreed and quite old.
Nicodemus, until a short time before when a
stout pen with a high board fence had been
built for him, was the terror of the community.
Three times he had broken loose. Each time
he had left fear and destruction behind him.</p>
<p>The first time old Deacon Gibson, a local
preacher, had been hiving a swarm of bees
when Nicodemus arrived on the scene. Nicodemus
had failed to assist in hiving that
swarm. Worse than that, he had butted the unfortunate
parson into three beehives and released
three other swarms upon him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>On his second escape, Nicodemus had boldly
entered the log school house while school was
in session. The teacher had climbed on top of
the table. Since there were only holes where
windows should have been, the children
swarmed through the window holes leaving
Nicodemus with the situation well in hand.
Since it was a warm day and Nicodemus was
tired, he had fallen asleep beneath the table.
Needless to say there had been no more school
that day.</p>
<p>Johnny laughed aloud as he recalled these
stories of the Colonel&rsquo;s prize ram. But now his
eyes were glued upon the high walled pen in
which Nicodemus was confined. Some living
creature beside Nicodemus had entered that
pen. He and Nicodemus were having it out.
Was Nicodemus chasing the intruder about or
was the wary old ram at last on the run?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be that bear we saw yesterday,&rdquo;
Johnny told himself. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve just got to see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>Johnny knew the Colonel and liked him. A
big, bluff, red-cheeked, jovial southern gentleman,
he was the idol of every boy who came
to know him. Nicodemus, despite all his reputation
for breaking up beehives and dismissing
schools, was a valuable ram. If anything seriously
threatened his safety, the Colonel should
know of it. Besides, there was a chance, a bare
chance, that Johnny, through this little adventure,
might become better acquainted with the
Colonel&rsquo;s daughter, Jensie.</p>
<p>Soon enough Johnny discovered that Nicodemus
was not in the slightest bit of danger,
unless, like many an aged and crusty human
being, he was in danger of bursting a blood
vessel because of unsatisfied rage.</p>
<p>As Johnny climbed the high board fence, to
peer with some misgiving into Nicodemus&rsquo; pen,
he barely held back a gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all things!&rdquo; he muttered. Then, having
lifted himself to a secure position atop a post,
he sat there, mouth open, eyes staring, witnessing
a strange performance.</p>
<p>There were indeed two living creatures in
that pen. One was the invincible Nicodemus.
The other, instead of being a bear, was a boy,
the fleetest footed boy Johnny had ever seen.</p>
<p>Johnny wanted to laugh. He longed to
shout. He did neither, for this would have
broken up the show. &ldquo;And that,&rdquo; he told himself,
&ldquo;would be a burning shame.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>And so it would. The boy and the ram were
playing a game of artful dodging. And the
boy, apparently, was a match for the ram.
Hugging some roundish, brown object under
one arm, he dashed squarely at the ram. Leaning
always toward the ram, he came within
three paces of him when, like a flash, he bent
to the right and, with the speed of a snapping
jack-knife, swerved slightly to one side and
passed the charging beast like a breath of air.</p>
<p>Voicing his disappointment in a low &ldquo;Ma&mdash;maa,&rdquo;
Nicodemus shook his head until it
seemed his massive horns would drop off, then
prepared to charge once again.</p>
<p>This time, as the ram came bursting down
the field, the boy stood stock still. With arms
outstretched, he appeared to offer his brown,
oblong burden to the ram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now! Now he&rsquo;ll get him!&rdquo; Johnny breathed.</p>
<p>But no. As the ram appeared about to strike
the boy amidship, with lightning-like speed, he
withdrew his offering, pivoted sharply to the
right to go dashing away, just in time to avoid
the terrific impact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; Johnny mumbled, &ldquo;that sure is
something!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>Then, like the whizbang of a fire cracker, a
thought struck him. Yes, this WAS something!
Something real indeed. Like a flash it
had come to him that the thing this strange
boy carried was a football, that this boy was a
marvel, that here was the answer to his prayer,
the fulfillment of his promises and his dreams.
Here was the much needed half-back. He
wanted to climb on top of the board fence and
let out one wild shout of joy.</p>
<p>But wait. Who was this boy? A mountain
boy to be sure. Was he through high school?
Probably not. Few mountain boys are. His
hopes dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who is he?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;Who
can he be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this question, for the time, he found no
answer. The boy wore a long vizored cap,
pulled low. The shadows hid his face. Yet
there was, Johnny assured himself, something
familiar about that slender form, those drooping
shoulders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>For a full quarter of an hour, awed, inspired,
entranced, Johnny witnessed this moonlight
duel between a boy and the champion of all
butting rams. Then, with a suddenness that
was startling, the affair came to an end. The
boy tried a new feature of the game. A dozen
swift steps backward spelled disaster. He
tripped over something behind him, recovered,
then straightened up just in time to receive the
full impact of the irate ram&rsquo;s headlong plunge.</p>
<p>The boy shot backward like an empty sack.
At the same time there was an explosion like
the bang of a shotgun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good grief!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed, starting to
the rescue.</p>
<p>But there was no need. The boy, still able to
travel under his own steam, made his way
across the field, to climb atop the fence and to
cling there panting.</p>
<p>He was now not twenty feet from Johnny.
But as yet he appeared unconscious of Johnny&rsquo;s
presence. In the final scrimmage, his cap
had been knocked from his head. Johnny recognized
him on the instant. It was Ballard
Ball, the boy from the mystery mill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Johnny spoke before he thought,
&ldquo;he got you. But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off as he caught the gleam of the
other boy&rsquo;s deep-set, dark eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Johnny apologized instantly.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to spy on you. I saw you
and Nicodemus, thought you might be that
bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That bear,&rdquo; Ballard laughed&mdash;his good humor
having suddenly returned. &ldquo;No bear&rsquo;d
ever have a chance with old Nicodemus. He&rsquo;d
be knocked out cold in the first round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it,&rdquo; Johnny began sliding along
the fence. &ldquo;But say!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Where
did you play football?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never did, not very much, you see,&rdquo; Ballard
laughed. &ldquo;We tried it over at the Gap. It
went fine until Squirrel-Head Blevins called
Blackie Madden a name he didn&rsquo;t like. Blackie
went home and got a gun. If the teacher hadn&rsquo;t
caught Blackie with it, Squirrel-Head wouldn&rsquo;t
be living now. So that&rsquo;s all the football there
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Gap?&rdquo; Johnny breathed a prayer.
&ldquo;Did you go to high school there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;I sort of graduated there last
June,&rdquo; Ballard admitted modestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; Johnny breathed. Then&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ballard, you&rsquo;re going to college. You&rsquo;re going
to play real, big-time football.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no! I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Ballard was all but
speechless. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got less than fifty dollars.
You&mdash;you can&rsquo;t go to college on that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you can!&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s tone was one of
finality. &ldquo;My granddad&rsquo;s one of the trustees
of Hillcrest College. He endowed a scholarship.
It&rsquo;s open. That will pay your tuition.
You can work for your room and board. More
than half the boys do that. Yes, you&rsquo;re going
to college. And will the coach be pleased! Ballard,
old boy, you&rsquo;re the answer to my prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Johnny,&rdquo; the mountain boy&rsquo;s voice hit
a flat note, &ldquo;I read somewhere that college
freshmen are not eligible to play football.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only in the big colleges and universities,&rdquo;
Johnny explained. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be eligible
in Hillcrest all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; Johnny said more quietly after
a moment. &ldquo;Now I can go fishing with a good
conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s college got to do with fishing?&rdquo;
Ballard asked in surprise.</p>
<p>Johnny told him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I must go to college so you can go fishing,&rdquo;
Ballard laughed. &ldquo;Well, one excuse is better
than none. Wait till I get my ball and I&rsquo;ll go
up the creek with you. He busted my ball, the
old rascal! But then maybe that sort of saved
my ribs. I&rsquo;ll not try the back-step after this.
Wait!&rdquo; He sprang into the pen, and before
Nicodemus could arrive, was back on the fence
with the deflated ball. And that was how Johnny
made his first move toward fulfilling his
promise to Coach Dizney of old Hillcrest. He
had done it with the aid of Nicodemus. There
was more to come, very much more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br />THE HAUNTED POOL</h2>
<p>Next day Johnny disappeared among the
rhododendrons and mountain ivy that
grow along the right bank of Pounding Mill
Creek. His step was light, his heart was gay.
And why not? Had he not fulfilled his mission?
Had he not discovered the much needed half-back
for the Hillcrest coach? And did he not
carry in his hands, beside a short split bamboo
rod, a can of &ldquo;soft craws&rdquo;? And were not soft
craws the bait of baits for this season of the
year? He looked with pride and joy upon the
half dozen crawfish, that, having recently shed
their shells, held up soft and harmless claws
for his inspection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get that old sport, the king of all black
bass, today,&rdquo; he assured himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have him
in less than an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He might have fulfilled this promise had it
not been for a lurking shadow that, passing
silently on before him, came to rest at last on
a rocky ledge, above the second deep pool in
Pounding Mill Creek.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>Johnny had little interest in that second pool
for the present. In fact that particular pool
had a peculiar sort of horror for Johnny. A
man had been drowned in that pool. He recalled
the story with a chill. A group of foreign
laborers, so the story went, had driven up
the creek from the Gap. They had meant to
dynamite this pool and get a mess of fish.
Since this was against the law and since they
found Zeb Page, a deputy sheriff, sitting on a
near-by boulder, they had decided to take a
swim. The pool was deep, all of twenty feet.
Four of the foreigners could swim. The water
was fine. They enjoyed it immensely.</p>
<p>They had all crawled out on the bank to sun
themselves when one of their number, who had
never known the delights of swimming, said,
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing. I can do that.&rdquo; He dove in,
clothes and all. He disappeared beneath the
placid surface of the pool. Ten seconds
elapsed, twenty, forty, a full moment, and he
did not reappear.</p>
<p>Alarmed, his comrades dove for him. Ten
minutes later they brought him to the top,
dead. In each of his two coat pockets, they
found a heavy revolver.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I always said,&rdquo; old Uncle Joe Creech always
exclaimed after telling this story, &ldquo;that totin&rsquo;
pistol guns would keep a good man down. And
that to my notion mighty nigh proves hit
plumb fer sarton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And folks do say,&rdquo; he would add with a
lowered voice and shifting eyes, &ldquo;that this here
foreigner can be heard on a still night in the
dark of the moon, a shootin&rsquo; off of them there
pistol guns. But then shucks!&rdquo; he would squirt
tobacco juice at a crack in the floor. &ldquo;Shucks!
How could he an&rsquo; him drowned and dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, how could he? All the same,
Johnny never dropped his bait in that deep
pool. He always had a shivery feeling that it
might catch on something soft and that if he
hauled in hard enough, he&rsquo;d bring a dead body
to the top. Pure fancy, he knew this to be, but
anyway there were enough other pools to be
fished in. Why not pass this one up? He
meant to pass it up on this day, as on all others,
but fate had decreed otherwise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>Quite forgetting the deep pool that lay just
beyond the last clump of mountain laurel,
Johnny happily dropped his first wriggling
soft craw into the shadowy waters of the pool
next to that one where, more than once, a
grand and glorious old black bass had eluded
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get him,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Get him for
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But would he? He waited. Lurking in the
shadows, he watched the dry line sink down,
inch by inch. Then, with a soundless parting
of the lips, he saw the line begin shooting
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bass,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Big old black bass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bass he knew, would run a yard, two,
three yards, then pause. Should he give the
line a quick jerk then, setting the hook? Or,
as many wise anglers advised, should he wait
for the second run?</p>
<p>The line ceased playing out. Old bass had
paused. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Johnny whispered. &ldquo;Now?
Or&mdash;&rdquo; He gave a quick jerk. He had him.
His heart leaped. He began reeling in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>Then his hopes fell, only a little fellow. It
must be. No real pull at all. Nor was he mistaken.
Close to the surface there appeared a
beautiful young bass, perhaps nine inches long,
the kind those mountain natives call &ldquo;green
pearch.&rdquo; With a deft snap of his line, Johnny
switched him off, then watched him as, for a
moment, stunned by the suddenness of it all,
he stood quite still in the water. Johnny&rsquo;s
thoughts were all admiration. How beautiful
he was, like the things a Chinaman does in
green lacquer.</p>
<p>But the big old black fellow, still lurking
down there somewhere in the shadows? What
of him? At once Johnny was alert. Drawing
in his line, he offered up one more precious soft
craw on the altar of a fisherman&rsquo;s hope.</p>
<p>Down, down went the craw-dad. Down,
down sunk the line. But what was this? Of a
sudden the line shot away. Startled, eyes bulging,
Johnny watched his line play out, a yard,
two, three, four, five, all but the length of the
pool.</p>
<p>Then, &ldquo;Now!&rdquo; he breathed once again. And&mdash;what?
Was he snagged on a rock? It
seemed so. But who could be sure? He
strained at his line cautiously. It did not
budge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow&rsquo;d think it was an alligator,&rdquo; he whispered.
He put a little more strain upon his
line. It gave to his touch. Then, of a sudden
it went slack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dumb! Got off! He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant the pole was all but jerked
from his hand and at precisely the same instant,
the most magnificent fish he had ever
seen leaped clear of the water. He leaped again
and yet again. Johnny&rsquo;s heart stood still. Then
as he saw the fish vanish, felt the tug and knew
he still had him, his heart went racing.</p>
<p>It was at this precise second in the long history
of the world that Johnny&rsquo;s ears were smitten
by an unearthly scream. It came from the
direction of that other pool, the foreigner&rsquo;s
death pool, the haunted pool. The scream was
repeated not once but twice. It was followed
by a loud splash.</p>
<p>There could be but one conclusion. Someone
had been about to fall into the pool. That
someone could not swim. Someone HAD fallen
into the deep pool.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>Johnny dropped his pole, heaved a sudden
sigh of regret and at the same time dashed
through the bushes. Arriving breathless at the
edge of that other pool, he saw a head rise partially
above the water. A mass of crinkly brown
hair floated on the surface. Without further
thought, Johnny plunged, clothes and all, into
the pool, to begin an Australian crawl toward
the spot where the head had been. But where
was it? For a space of ten seconds, he could
not locate it. When at last his racing gaze
came to rest, it was upon a spot close to the
opposite bank. The head was there, also a pair
of fair, round shoulders.</p>
<p>Johnny paused in his swimming to see a girl,
of some sixteen summers, emerge, fully
clothed and dripping, from the pool.</p>
<p>Just then she turned about to look at him
and say, as a rare smile played about her lips,
&ldquo;Oh! You in swimming too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To measure Johnny&rsquo;s emotions at that moment
would be impossible. The girl was beautiful.
But the witch? Why had she screamed?
Had she meant to deceive him? And his fish?
Gone of course. Even a Tennessee shad could
loose himself from a drifting pole like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, speaking slowly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in
swimming. I fell in, same as you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t fall in,&rdquo; the girl shook the water
from her hair. &ldquo;I jumped in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you always scream like that when
you dive?&rdquo; Johnny was puzzled and angry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly always.&rdquo; The girl sat down upon a
rock in the bright sunshine. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some
sort of bird that screams before he dives. I
like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose,&rdquo; Johnny said mockingly,
&ldquo;that you always go in clothes and all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always,&rdquo; she said soberly. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be
quite decent not to unless you have a bathing
suit. And I haven&rsquo;t one. I&rsquo;ve asked Dad to buy
me one many times but he always forgets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Dad?&rdquo; Johnny asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad is Colonel Crider. I&rsquo;m Jensie Crider.
Now please,&rdquo; there was a friendly note in her
voice, &ldquo;stop being ugly. Come on out in the
sun. We&rsquo;ll be all dry in a half hour. I want
you to tell me about a lot of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jensie Crider, Johnny was thinking to himself.
The very girl I&rsquo;ve wanted to know. And
such a meeting as this!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You made me lose a black bass, a&mdash;a whopper,&rdquo;
he grinned in spite of himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo; she was all sympathy.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll find you another, a bigger one. You
wait and see!&rdquo; She stood up to shake herself
until her damp garments spun about her.
&ldquo;Now please do come up and get all dried
out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>Who could but obey this order from so beautiful
a siren?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell me,&rdquo; she said when Johnny had
settled himself upon the rock, &ldquo;what do you do
besides catch fish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I go scouting for football players.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you find them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found one last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down here in the mountains?&rdquo; she voiced
her surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Ballard Ball. You&rsquo;d be astonished. He&rsquo;s
an artful dodger. I&mdash;&rdquo; he was about to tell her
how he had found him but changed his mind.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to take him with me to college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, college.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s voice dropped.
&ldquo;Father wants me to go to college. I&rsquo;m not
going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny told her why. He spoke in such
glowing terms of big football games, wild rallies,
of bonfires, and sings around great open
fireplaces, the joyous friendships of youth and
the satisfaction to be had from learning something
new every day that at last quoting from
last Sabbath&rsquo;s Sunday School lesson, she murmured:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Almost thou persuadest me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see!&rdquo; she sprang to her feet. &ldquo;Now we
are all dry. And I shall keep my promise. Now
for that big, black bass!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br />THE CRIMSON FLOOD</h2>
<p>Several days later, Johnny Thompson
found himself crouching on the western
sidelines of the football field at old Hillcrest.
He had been there a half hour. During that
time a variety of interests had vied for the attention
of his active brain.</p>
<p>For a time he had thought of the mill down
there at the foot of Stone Mountain in the
Cumberlands. All that seemed quite far away
now. Yet the strangeness and mystery of it
lingered. He had not forgotten his resolve to
solve that mystery. In his mind&rsquo;s vision now
he saw it all. Now the ancient mill, its secret
trap door and the serious minded Donald Day
presiding over it all. Johnny had hoped that
Donald would tell him the secret of those
strange recesses at the bottom of the old mill.
He had pictured himself saying, &ldquo;Donald, old
son, how can you take an empty, double
walled jug down there and bring it back full
of something quite valuable when there is
nothing down there but air and water?&rdquo; He
had never asked the question, had never quite
dared. So the mystery of the mill remained a
mystery still.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>The old master of the mill, Malcomb MacQueen,
was still in the hospital. Apparently
his fall, when the bridge came down, had resulted
in very serious injuries. No one seemed
to know when he might be about again. One
thing was sure, everyone would be glad when
that day came. &ldquo;How those mountain people
do love him!&rdquo; Johnny whispered as he
crouched on the sidelines waiting for action.</p>
<p>And Ballard? Ah, that was the question uppermost
in Johnny&rsquo;s mind at this moment. As
he crouched there waiting for the kick off of
that first of the season&rsquo;s games, he asked himself
over and over, &ldquo;What about Ballard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he told the coach that he had found a
star half-back for him, a sure winner who in all
his life had played but three games of football
and had been given no opportunity to shine in
these, the coach had indulged in that quaint
but classic expression: &ldquo;Oh yeah?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>But Johnny had remained undismayed.
&ldquo;You wait and see!&rdquo; had been his only reply.
He had not told of the late night tryst with
the champion butter of all rams, old Nicodemus.
It seemed a little strange to him as he
thought of it now. &ldquo;Wait and see,&rdquo; he had repeated.
That was all. Now they were waiting.
They were to see. The zero hour was approaching.
Cedarville, the visiting team, would
kick off to Hillcrest. An important game? All
games of a series are important. Seven games
were to be played for the championship of the
Little Seven League.</p>
<p>No one wanted Hillcrest to win as Johnny
did. He wanted his find, Ballard Ball, to turn
out to be a star of the first magnitude. He
wanted the Hillcrest boys to win because he
knew and loved them. More than that, Hillcrest
had been his father&rsquo;s school. Johnny&rsquo;s
father had died while he was still young, not,
however, until he had fired Johnny&rsquo;s boyish
mind with tales of football battles of good, old,
half forgotten days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They used to win,&rdquo; Johnny had said to Ballard
that very morning. &ldquo;Win and win and
win! Last year Hillcrest lost and lost and lost.
Hillcrest has not carried off the pennant for
six years.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>To this Ballard had made no reply. Johnny
thought he saw the lines tighten about his thin,
serious face. He was sure he caught a gleam
from those dark, deep-set eyes. That was all.
It was enough. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; had been his mental
comment. Now the eternal question came
back to him, &ldquo;Will he do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they come!&rdquo; a high-pitched voice
cried. The speaker was close beside Johnny.
&ldquo;Here they come! The Crimson Tide!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Jensie Crider who, wakening Johnny
from his reverie, brought him to his feet with
a snap. Yes, Jensie, the same Jensie, who had
screamed three times then leaped, full dressed,
into that mountain pool was here. And, miracle
of miracles, wild and free as she had been
down in the hills, today she was garbed in a
sober costume and going to college, Johnny&rsquo;s
college, old Hillcrest. Something to marvel at
here.</p>
<p>No time for that now though, for indeed,
here they came, the Hillcrest team, the Crimson
Flood as Jensie had named them.</p>
<p>The ball had been kicked off. A long, high,
rocketing kick, it had been gathered in by
Punch Dickman, the Hillcrest full-back, and
now here they came.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>To Johnny at that moment, they seemed a
crimson tide indeed. Their red jersies flaming
in the sun, they were like the onrush of a flaming
prairie fire. Johnny&rsquo;s own heart flamed at
sight of them.</p>
<p>Among them all, one figure stood out boldly.
A large, heavy boned boy, he moved with the
determined gallop of a stubborn two year old
colt. He ran just ahead of the ball carrier.
When a boy in orange and blue leaped toward
the carrier, he was met not by the big full-back
but by this other boy. Hillcrest&rsquo;s left
end whose name was Dave Powers. Dave
spilled him as easily as he might have a tea-wagon
laden with dishes. Two others of the
orange and blue went down before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at &rsquo;em!&rdquo; Johnny thrilled to the core
of his being. &ldquo;Thirty yard line, forty, forty-five,
fifty. Over the center, forty-five! Forty!
There! There he&rsquo;s down on the Cedarville
thirty-seven yard line. Yow-ee! What a
run-back. It&rsquo;s a good sign, Jensie! A very
good sign!&rdquo; He slapped his companion on the
back as if she were a boy. And she came back
with a feigned punch to the jaw.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But Ballard?&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s thoughts sobered.
Ballard, the slim dark-eyed mountain boy was
in there at right half. The coach was giving
him his chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Dizney!&rdquo; Johnny muttered.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll make good,&rdquo; Jensie exclaimed. &ldquo;Ballard
will make good. I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pal,&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s heart warmed toward
the girl. Once down there in the Cumberlands
he had fairly hated her for making
him lose a fine black bass. He was all for her
now.</p>
<p>Hillcrest had the ball. The run-back had
been wonderful, but, after that for a time,
things were not so good. Johnny saw at a
glance that the Hillcrest team was outweighed
fifteen pounds to the man. And, in the beginning
games at least, weight does count.</p>
<p>Hillcrest tried a smash through right tackle.
No good. They attempted an end run with
Ballard carrying the ball. Johnny caught his
breath as he saw the mountain boy tuck the
ball under his arm. &ldquo;First blood,&rdquo; he muttered.
Two enemies broke through the line. Ballard
dodged one, appeared to offer the ball to the
second, then pivoted and faded out to the right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Great stuff!&rdquo; Johnny murmured.</p>
<p>In the end, however, the mountain boy was
thrown for a loss of two yards. One more
down, then came the punt.</p>
<p>A Cedarville man carried the ball to his own
forty yard line. Then followed a terrific pounding
of the Hillcrest line that resulted in four
first downs, a thirty yard run through the line
and at last a touchdown by the invaders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Jensie sighed, it was the first real
game she had ever witnessed. &ldquo;How can we
win when they ram the line like a flock of
goats?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or rams?&rdquo; Johnny chuckled in spite of
himself. &ldquo;But wait,&rdquo; he consoled her, &ldquo;our
team will take to the air. Then you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take to the air?&rdquo; Jensie was puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to beat them with passes,&rdquo;
Johnny explained.</p>
<p>He looked at the girl beside him and marvelled.
From his strange introduction&mdash;or
lack of introduction&mdash;back there in the mountain
pool, he had suspected her of being a trifle
crude. To his vast surprise, he had found her
very much of a lady.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>As he thought of it now, while Cedarville
took time out before a try at the goal, as he
recalled the few happy days spent with her
there in the mountains, he found himself thinking
of her as he might have thought of the fine
type of English girl, who rides after the
hounds, plays golf, cricket, and tennis, and is
a fine-spoken, properly dressed young person
for all that.</p>
<p>Ride after the hounds? Well, they had not
quite done that. They had followed the Colonel&rsquo;s
favorite hounds over the ridges, hunting
squirrels. They had risen two hours before
dawn to walk through the dewy moonlight to
a cornfield. There they had treed two fat, marauding
old coons and had, as Jensie put it,
&ldquo;Shot them at sunrise.&rdquo; They had&mdash;</p>
<p>But there was the kick for the extra point.
No good, off to the right. Johnny cheered with
the rest but his gaze was wandering from the
coach to Ballard, then from Ballard to the
coach again. What was the coach thinking of
Ballard? Probably nothing. He hadn&rsquo;t been
given a chance. He&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! There they go!&rdquo; Jensie cried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>At once Johnny&rsquo;s eyes were on the ball.
Cedarville had kicked off to Hillcrest. By some
strange chance, it was Ballard who caught the
ball. It was no mere chance that Dave Powers,
the left end, was at Ballard&rsquo;s side&mdash;he had a
way of being near the runner. Together they
sprinted down the line, but not for long. Ballard&rsquo;s
course was too much of a snake-dance
for Dave. He dodged there, pivoted here,
leaped straight at a would-be tackler, then
shot to the right. Eluding all would-be tacklers,
leaving his team mates far behind, the
slim Kentucky boy set the bleachers howling
with delight. Had it not been for the lone
safety man who rushed him and downed him
at the fifteen yard line, it must surely have
been a touchdown from a run-back&mdash;a marvelous
feat. As it was Hillcrest went wild with
the yell:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea Ballard! Yea Ballard! Ballard! Ballard!
Touchdown! Touchdown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A touchdown it was, and that on the very
next play. Little Artie Stark, Hillcrest&rsquo;s midget
quarter-back, took the ball, lateralled a
slow pass to Dave Powers at end, and Dave,
plunging like a bucking bronco, shot through
the line.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yea! Yea! Yea!&rdquo; even Jensie, who until
now had watched the game in passive silence,
joined in the cheering.</p>
<p>The kick was good. The score stood 7-6 in
favor of Hillcrest.</p>
<p>There followed moments of tense struggle.
Hillcrest won the ball and lost it. Cedarville
battled their way to the ten yard line only to
lose the ball on a fumble. Hillcrest took to the
air but with little success. Pass after pass
dropped to earth incomplete.</p>
<p>At last there was but seven minutes left to
play. The day was warm for autumn. Both
teams showed the strain. Hillcrest tried one
more forward pass only to meet with disaster.
It was intercepted by the opponent&rsquo;s right end.
He went romping down the field for a second
touchdown. The kick was good. Score 13 to
7 against Hillcrest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, boys,&rdquo; Johnny shouted as, having
taken time out, the Hillcrest boys lay
sprawled out before him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll win.
There&rsquo;s six minutes yet to play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Than-thanks Johnny. Thanks for them
few kind words,&rdquo; came from a member of the
team. Ballard did not so much as look up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead on his feet,&rdquo; Johnny whispered
to Jensie. &ldquo;The coach should take him out,
but he&rsquo;s afraid he&rsquo;ll break him if he does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Ballard,&rdquo; Jensie whispered back. &ldquo;I
wish he&rsquo;d have some luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jensie was deeply interested in Ballard.
They had gone to school together, she and Ballard,
for years. It had mattered little that her
home was large, her father rich; his home
small, his family poor. They were friends.</p>
<p>When grade school was over Jensie had been
sent away to a high class private boarding
school for girls. This had lasted exactly three
weeks. Jensie had pined away for her beloved
mountains, her childhood comrades, and the
glorious freedom of public schools. She ran
away from Madame Farar&rsquo;s select finishing
school. She came home to the mountains. Her
father had chuckled over her rebellion and had
sent her, with Ballard and all her other childhood
pals to the high school at the Gap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>She had not wanted to go away to college.
The appearance of Johnny Thompson on the
scene had changed all that. Johnny had painted
glowing pictures of college, of basket ball,
football, pep-meetings, evenings about the
open fire in the big &ldquo;dorm&rdquo; and all else that
goes to make college glorious. Johnny himself
was a rather glamorous figure. And Ballard
was going. That was enough. So, here she
was. And here was Ballard of her own Pounding
Mill Creek, on a football team that apparently
could not win.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They MUST win!&rdquo; She set her teeth hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They shall win!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed.</p>
<p>Would they? It did not seem so, for once
again, as play was resumed, the opponents began
battering their shattered line, marching
down the field toward one more touchdown.</p>
<p>But not so fast! The Hillcrest line stiffened.
Three downs and no gain. Cedarville was
forced to kick. The ball shot skyward like a
rocket to drop right into Artie Stark&rsquo;s waiting
arms. Artie raced forward for a gain of twenty
yards. With a tackler at his heels he hurled a
forward pass to Dave Powers. Dave sprang
into the Cedarville mob. He dodged here,
pivoted there, was about to be tackled, then
lateralled back to Artie Stark half way across
the field and all alone.</p>
<p>By this time the Hillcrest bleachers had gone
mad. Even the Cedarville rooters were
screaming at the tops of their voices.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Touchdown! Touchdown!&rdquo; yelled the excited
mob. Johnny looked at his watch. &ldquo;One
minute to play, one minute for a touchdown.
Regular Jack Armstrong football,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>Almost, but not quite. Finding himself in
the open and in full possession of the treasured
pigskin, Artie Stark once again shot forward
toward the goal line. An enemy appeared on
the right. He dodged him. One on the left,
another on the right, a third directly before
him. No chance. His eyes roved the field.
&ldquo;Than&mdash;thanks, good fortune,&rdquo; he murmured
as he sent the ball on a long, looping curve
toward Ballard Ball, the slim Kentucky boy,
who stood waiting all alone on the enemy&rsquo;s five
yard line. It was a perfect pass. Ballard was
not obliged to move a foot. The ball dropped
squarely in his arms. Yet&mdash;Johnny could not
believe his eyes&mdash;the ball went bouncing in air
to at last strike the earth and roll away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Incomplete pass,&rdquo; Johnny groaned. &ldquo;One,
two, three passes, all incomplete. The ball goes
back miles and miles. And with only a half
minute left to play.&rdquo; He groaned again and
all Hillcrest groaned with him. And well they
might for, scarcely had the teams lined up for
play when the whistle blew. The game was
over. Hillcrest had lost 13 to 7.</p>
<p>When Johnny and Jensie went in search of
Ballard they did not find him on the field. He
had vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny, we must find him,&rdquo; Jensie exclaimed.
&ldquo;We really must! I know Ballard.
I&rsquo;ve known him a long, long time. He&rsquo;s too
good to be true. He&rsquo;ll blame himself for
the loss of that game. He&mdash;why he may start
for home tonight. You never can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />OLD KENTUCKY</h2>
<p>After a futile search for Ballard, Johnny
wandered back to the Blue Moon. The
Blue Moon was Johnny&rsquo;s latest financial venture
in a strange and troubled world. It promised
to be a grand flop and Johnny was duly
unhappy about it.</p>
<p>The establishing of the Blue Moon had been
a suggestion of Johnny&rsquo;s grandfather. The old
man was seldom wrong. This time, however,
it did seem that he had erred.</p>
<p>It had started with Johnny&rsquo;s determination
to find his young Kentucky friend a job, anything
at all that would enable him to earn
money for food and lodging. At first it had
seemed simple enough. In the end it proved
impossible. Everything was taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Way to get a job these days,&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s
grandfather had said, &ldquo;is to make one for
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Johnny grinned, &ldquo;but how?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not so hard as it might seem,&rdquo; the old man
rumbled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it for quite
a spell. You know college boys like a place to
gather and talk things over, have a cup of coffee
or hot malted, sort of a gathering place of
the clan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Johnny agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been watching them. They wander
down town, go in here, go in there, gather in
places, not so bad, not so good either, little
gambling, slot machines and all that, little bad
language from rough town folks, all that sort
of thing. If I had a boy away from home, I&rsquo;d
like him in a better place. So why not, Johnny?&rdquo;
The old man leaned forward eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not what?&rdquo; Johnny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not turn that abandoned bowling alley
building just off the campus into a sort of
student&rsquo;s retreat, place where they can buy little
things they need, sit down for a hot drink,
gather around for a bit of conversation, all
that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the fixtures for you, took them on
a bad debt. They&rsquo;re in storage. I&rsquo;ll finance it
for you. Make a job for both you and Ballard.
What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grand!&rdquo; Johnny had all but hugged the old
man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>They had worked hard to make the place
attractive, Johnny and Ballard had. Jensie had
added a feminine touch, with a picture or two
and colored curtains. She had imported for
them a southern negro cook who could make
famous little meat pies and apple turn overs,
the sort that melt in your mouth.</p>
<p>The place was, Johnny decided, to have very
few rules, one was that this was a place for
men only. Perhaps this rule was a mistake.
One thing was sure, the student body had not,
as yet, found their way in any great numbers
to the Blue Moon, as Johnny and Jensie had
named it. The place gave promise of being a
prodigious failure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the boys like to wander down
town and fill their eyes with the bright light
of neon signs,&rdquo; Johnny told himself gloomily,
as having entered the big, front room of the
place, he prodded the fire, thrust in three large
logs, then seated himself for a short spell of
gloomy meditation.</p>
<p>This meditation was broken in upon by Jensie
who thrusting her head in at the open door
said, &ldquo;Johnny, do you think Ballard could have
lit out for our native hills?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was Johnny&rsquo;s slow reply.
&ldquo;Guess not though. Probably just went for a
long walk to wear off his grief at dropping that
ball. Come on in and have a meat pie an&rsquo; a
cup of coffee. It&rsquo;s on the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rules, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang the rules!&rdquo; Johnny exploded. &ldquo;We
made &rsquo;em. We can break &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; his voice dropped to a disconsolate
note, &ldquo;I think the place is a flop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! It can&rsquo;t be. It mustn&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; Jensie exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can hang a hollow log up in a tree,&rdquo;
was Johnny&rsquo;s strange reply, &ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t
make a squirrel choose it for a nest. Anyway
come on in. I&rsquo;m sure the coffee is still hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was. They drank three cups apiece and
felt better, much better. Two banjos lay on the
shelf back of the counter. Taking up one of
these Jensie put a hand on the counter, gave a
little spring, and there she was, seated on the
counter as she had been many a time in Cousin
Bill&rsquo;s store down in the Cumberland mountains.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>She touched the strings and at once, strange,
quaint mountain melodies began pouring forth
on the still night air. They were alone, just
Johnny and the girl. But not for long. The
door was open. The thrum-thrum-thrum of the
banjo carried far. Into the dim lit room, shadowy
figures like dark ghosts began to glide.
One by one, each in his corner, they came to
rest. Johnny could not see their faces. He
could guess who they were and was glad. It
promised well for the future of the Blue Moon.</p>
<p>Then a tall, slim, slouching figure appeared.
Both Johnny and Jensie recognized him at a
glance. Johnny felt a wave of warmth creep
over him. Jensie gulped, paused, then played
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, gimme that thar banjo,&rdquo; drawled a
low, melodious voice. &ldquo;Blame me, if you ain&rsquo;t
the sorriest banjo picker I mighty nigh ever
heard.&rdquo; It was Ballard.</p>
<p>Jensie did not give up the banjo. Instead,
she reached over, took down the second banjo,
then slid over, making a place for Ballard beside
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, boy,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s give
&rsquo;em a little touch of old Kentucky.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>A moment more and two banjos were
thrumming where one had been before, and
two melodious voices were drawling the words
of &ldquo;Kentucky Babe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound carried farther now. New recruits
to the voluntary audience were arriving.
Some were boys and some girls. Two gray-haired
professors sidled into a corner. Rules?
Tonight there were no rules. They had lost
the first big game of the season. One and all
they were in need of consolation. They were
getting it from these mountain singers.</p>
<p>From &ldquo;Kentucky Babe&rdquo; the melodious pair
went to &ldquo;Moonlight on the Wabash&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Springtime in the Rockies.&rdquo; Then, with a
sudden low strumming of strings, they drifted
away into some sweet, haunting melody of the
mountains, a song without words, never written
down but loved and remembered by every
new mountain generation.</p>
<p>A hush fell over the audience as it ended.
The hush deepened as the strings took up an
old, old refrain and the untrained melodious
voices began: &ldquo;The sun shines bright on my
old Kentucky home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>The hush continued all through the song.
Surely no audience had ever accorded a more
perfect reception. For a full moment there was
silence. Then a voice exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, Kentucky! Yea! Yea! Old Kentucky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly the throng was on its feet as the
rafters rang with the shout:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kentucky! Old Kentucky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny choked something down his throat.
Perhaps it was his heart. By Old Kentucky,
he knew they meant Ballard. The name would
stick. Ballard was made for life. So too he
hoped, was the Blue Moon. He touched a
switch. Instantly like a smile from Heaven
the light at the center of the ceiling beamed
down upon them. Johnny found himself looking
into a half hundred smiling faces. The
team was there, almost to a man. Some of the
girls were there. Those professors and six
strangers completed the list.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>But here was Artie Stark. He was on his
feet. He was speaking: &ldquo;Folks, this is to be a
pep meeting, not a funeral!&rdquo; Instant applause.
&ldquo;What we need to do is find out what it takes
to win next Saturday&rsquo;s game. I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;
Artie&rsquo;s round freckled and usually smiling face
was serious. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what we need. It&rsquo;s
practice! How can we win? By getting out on
the air! Basketball! That&rsquo;s it. Basketball on
the football field. That takes practice, hours
and hours of practice. I know what you&rsquo;re going
to say, &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the time? All right for
you,&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t have to work,
Artie.&rsquo; Look!&rdquo; Artie broke short off to allow
his eyes to circle the crowd. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the best
ball carrier we&rsquo;ve got this year? Who&rsquo;s the
artful dodger? There he is!&rdquo; He pointed
straight at Ballard. &ldquo;Old Kentucky. That&rsquo;s
who it is!&rdquo; Once again the crowd cheered,
this time long and huskily. Ballard turned
red, struggled with something in his throat,
made a few gurgling sounds, then sat there in
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he need?&rdquo; Artie demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He needs practice, to become air-minded.
That&rsquo;s what it will take to win! And practice,
that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s going to get. I&rsquo;m going to
serve up chocolate sodas, banana splits, and
ham sandwiches in this old Blue Moon of
Johnny&rsquo;s. I don&rsquo;t have to work but I&rsquo;m going
to, for good old Hillcrest and all she stands
for.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&mdash;&rdquo; Ballard was on his feet. It matters
little what he meant to say. Wild cheers
drowned all his efforts at speech.</p>
<p>As for Johnny, his head was in a whirl.
Artie Stark was to be his aid at the Blue Moon!
Artie, the most popular boy in the whole
school! What a boost the old Blue Moon was
going to get!</p>
<p>An hour later, when arrangements had all
been made for the future and the crowd had
melted away, Johnny was preparing to throw
the light switch, lock the door and go home,
when his attention was attracted by some
stranger who still lingered in the shadows.</p>
<p>Wonder what he wants, Johnny thought.
There was something familiar about the stooping
shoulders, the large, dark glasses of the
stranger. &ldquo;Did&mdash;did you want something?&rdquo; he
asked hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes I&mdash;&rdquo; the stranger came forward. &ldquo;You
may have forgotten. It&rsquo;s been quite a while
Johnny, but I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good grief!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Panther
Eye! My old pal Panther Eye!&rdquo; Next
instant he was gripping the other boy&rsquo;s hand
until it hurt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />PANTHER EYE&rsquo;S RETURN</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Pant,&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s mind spun like
a top. &ldquo;Pant! Good old Panther Eye.
Sit down here. I&rsquo;ll switch off that big light.
There now! That&rsquo;s more like it. What&rsquo;s the
good of light for a fellow like you? See in the
dark well as the light. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be right back,
Pant. Got coffee! Lot of good hot coffee and
hamburger, just right hamburger. Have a
feast, Pant, and talk just like we used to.
Jungles, Pant, and the great, white wilderness.
Submarine in the Chicago river. Man! Oh,
man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this, as if suddenly realizing he was talking
like a madman, Johnny ducked away toward
the kitchen where, with shaky fingers,
he laid crisp, brown hamburgers between
round sliced rolls and poured great, steaming
mugs of coffee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>All the time he was thinking. Panther Eye
of all people! Panther Eye, you will know if
you have been Johnny Thompson&rsquo;s friend for
long, had for a long time been Johnny&rsquo;s boon
companion. Then, quite suddenly and mysteriously,
he had dropped out of his life. Nothing
very strange about this for, after all, Pant
had always been a mysterious person. He
could see in the dark quite as well as in the
light. This marvelous gift had more than once
gotten them out of a tight place. Rumor had it
that Pant and a great surgeon had been hunting
panthers. A panther had torn out the
boy&rsquo;s eye. The surgeon had shot the panther,
cut out its eye skillfully, set it in the place of
the one Pant had lost and now, like all cats,
he could see in the dark. A likely sort of story.
But then, how could you explain it? Pant had
once told Johnny he did it with the aid of some
mechanical lighting device. Johnny had not
quite believed that. What was one to believe?
At any rate, here was Pant back again. Where
had he been? Johnny wanted awfully to know.
They&rsquo;d have a grand talk about old times. Pant
would tell of some fresh adventures. And
then? Johnny was actually trembling with anticipation.
Things would happen, they always
did when Pant was about, weird, mysterious
things. Oh well, this made life seem worth
living. So let them come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Remember the Dust Eater?&rdquo; Pant was saying
three minutes later. &ldquo;Remember the airship
and all those little brown men way up there in
the north?&rdquo; Pant&rsquo;s strange eyes shone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Siberian tiger?&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes, Johnny! Them were the days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every day is a good day,&rdquo; Johnny philosophized.
&ldquo;Every day&rsquo;s got to be better than the
one that went before. There&rsquo;s no turning back
Pant, old boy. We&rsquo;ve got to go forward. But
what have you been doing, Pant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Satan always does,&rdquo; Pant smiled
strangely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Johnny stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember, Johnny? You should
read old and treasured very old books. They
help a lot in understanding life. Satan when
asked where he had been is supposed to have
said he had come &lsquo;From going to and fro in the
earth, and from walking up and down in it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Johnny grinned. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s got a better
right to follow Satan&rsquo;s example than you,
Pant. But where did you walk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Africa, Ethiopia to be more explicit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s breath came quick with surprise.
&ldquo;The one place I&rsquo;d most like to have
been! What were you doing? What happened?
Plenty I&rsquo;ll bet! Tell me about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well you know,&rdquo; Pant slumped down comfortably
in his chair, then, as there came some
slight noise outside, sprang half out of his seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re nervous,&rdquo; Johnny looked at him in
surprise. &ldquo;Nervous as a cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be too, Johnny, if&mdash;&rdquo; Pant did not
finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Johnny,&rdquo; he began again a half minute
later, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a brother. Didn&rsquo;t know it,
did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, Johnny. And like myself, he&rsquo;s a bit
queer, only in a different way. He&rsquo;s a naturalist
of a sort. He hunts up all kinds of queer
animals. And Ethiopia&rsquo;s the place to look for
them. You&rsquo;d hardly believe the truth, Johnny,
antelopes no taller than a good sized cat,
crows with great, thick bills, monkeys with
capes growing on their backs to keep off the
rain, and baboons! All sorts of man-like creatures!
That&rsquo;s Ethiopia. My brother went down
there to hunt out these creatures. He got himself
lost and I had to go find him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a strange place, Johnny, awfully
strange. Things happen that you don&rsquo;t forget,
you&rsquo;ll never forget.&rdquo; Pant&rsquo;s eyes sought the
dark corners of the room. His slim fingers
toyed nervously with his coffee cup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find your brother?&rdquo; Johnny asked.</p>
<p>Pant did not appear to hear. Perhaps he did
not. There are times in all our lives when we
are living so much in the past that nothing
close to us seems real.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are spots in that strange land,&rdquo; Pant
went on as if Johnny had not spoken. &ldquo;Spots
so beautiful you fancy they may have been the
Garden of Eden. Beautiful? Yes, beautiful
beyond compare&mdash;&ldquo; Pant drew in a long, deep
breath. &ldquo;Just imagine, Johnny, passing
through a tropical jungle. You can imagine,
can&rsquo;t you? Remember&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Johnny said quietly, &ldquo;I remember
Central America. The mahogany forests,
tangled bushes and vines. The hush of night
at noonday in the deep shade of the forests,
the bright flash of birds, the damp, sweet smell
of a thousand flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Johnny,&rdquo; Pant sighed, &ldquo;you do remember.
And, Johnny, African jungles are
wilder, ruggeder, grander, more lonely. Johnny,&rdquo;
his voice fell, &ldquo;imagine all that, then try
to think what it would be like to catch a
sound, a voice, singing beautifully. Not a
bird&rsquo;s voice, Johnny, a human voice, a girl&rsquo;s
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the jungle either,&rdquo; again Pant
paused, he seemed to be experiencing it all
again. &ldquo;Think of walking a few steps forward
then, after parting the bushes, to find yourself
looking down upon a&mdash;a sort of paradise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to picture it, Johnny.&rdquo; Pant leaned
forward. &ldquo;Try to see it as I saw it then, a
broad, green pasture, flat as a floor and green
as no pasture in America ever is. Back of that
pasture a grove of date palms and among
these, set like a diamond in green jade, a jewel
of a house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bananas hung on bunches at the edge of a
garden near by,&rdquo; Pant breathed deeply. &ldquo;Oranges
and grapefruit all green and gold, were
there too. And, Johnny,&rdquo; again his voice fell,
&ldquo;Johnny, right in the foreground of that picture,
as if she had been put there by an artist,
and the whole thing was not real, just painted,
was a girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A white girl?&rdquo; Johnny spoke at last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She may have been all white,&rdquo; Pant spoke
slowly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. Queer isn&rsquo;t
it? I was with her for hours. I never asked
myself the question, not once until now. But
then, when you&rsquo;re helping a pretty girl who is
in great peril you don&rsquo;t ask yourself, &lsquo;What
race does she belong to?&rsquo; now do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helping a beautiful girl in great peril!&rdquo;
Johnny sat up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what it came to in the end.
That&rsquo;s what I was going to tell you&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But say!&rdquo; Pant broke off suddenly. &ldquo;Here
it is eleven o&rsquo;clock! I&rsquo;ve got just ten minutes
to make it!&rdquo; He grabbed for his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make what?&rdquo; Johnny received no answer.
Pant was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same old Pant,&rdquo; Johnny murmured after
a moment&rsquo;s thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>Johnny sat there for a short time staring
into his half drained coffee cup. Life had, he
thought, always been strange. Curious, mysterious
things were always bobbing up. Life
was a joyous affair too. It sure was good to
live. The coming weeks promised to be full of
interest. There was that queer old man and
his nephew, Donald Day, down there in the
mountains. They took jug-like affairs into a
dark, cavern-like place beneath a mill, carried
them down empty and brought them up filled
with some precious fluid. How could they?
What magic was this? He was going to know.
His grandfather had given him a small car, a
long, low one with a nose like a chisel. Cut
the air like a knife, this car. He&rsquo;d go spinning
down to the mountains in it. Take Jensie or
Ballard with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Kentucky. That&rsquo;s what they all called
Ballard tonight,&rdquo; he whispered. He was thinking
of Ballard. Yes, surely life was joyous,
grand and joyous. Things had a way of coming
out right if you got a proper start and kept
plugging. There was the Blue Moon now. It
was going to be a success. Students needed
such a meeting place, good, clean atmosphere,
and all that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just takes one good push,&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;Tonight it got that push. Ballard got his
push too. He&rsquo;ll make a great football star. I&rsquo;m
sure of it. I&mdash;&rdquo; he broke off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>Then, like a ghost, a mental picture of Panther
Eye came floating into his consciousness.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been into something I&rsquo;ll be bound,&rdquo; he
said this aloud to the empty room. &ldquo;Nothing
bad, but something that&rsquo;s likely to get some
people into a lot of trouble of one sort or another.
Pant&rsquo;s just naturally that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble for some people,&rdquo; he repeated musingly.
&ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t be one of those people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh won&rsquo;t you though!&rdquo; He would have
sworn that a voice whispered this in his ear.
Springing to his feet, he flashed a look here,
there, everywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Of course not.
Time I was going home. Been a wild day. I&rsquo;m
beginning to hear things. Be seeing them
pretty soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that he switched off the light, opened the
door, then stood on the threshold listening,
peering into the dark. Strangely enough, at
that moment a curious notion took possession
of his mind, it was that the mysterious Panther
Eye had not been there at all, that Pant was
dead, that only Pant&rsquo;s ghost had been to visit
him here in the big room of the Blue Moon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boo!&rdquo; he shivered.</p>
<p>He was sure he caught an answering &ldquo;Boo!&rdquo;
But after all it might have been some lonesome
old owl talking to himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br />HA! HA! BIG JOKE!</h2>
<p>The game on the following Saturday was
strange. Johnny, who journeyed with the
team to Chehalis, where the game was to be
played, had never seen anything like it. Something
quite mysterious and startling happened
at the beginning of the second quarter. The
score stood at 7-7. It was Hillcrest&rsquo;s ball on
their opponent&rsquo;s twenty yard line, second
down, and ten yards to go.</p>
<p>At that moment, while it was being returned
from an unsuccessful attempt at a forward
pass, in some strange manner, the ball came
into contact with a Chehalis player&rsquo;s toe and
went bouncing into the bleachers. Johnny saw
this but thought little of it. He was to think
a great deal more of it later.</p>
<p>The ball was slow in getting back onto the
field. This was not strange however, it was
a cold day. Many blankets tended to hamper
the spectator&rsquo;s movements.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>When the ball came back it was Rabbit
Jones, Hillcrest right half, who received it.
The ball, he thought, seemed queer, yet he
said nothing. Twenty seconds later the ball
was in play. Rabbit had it and was preparing
to throw a forward pass to Dave Powers, who
had run around left end to receive it.</p>
<p>Then Rabbit did a strange thing. To the
vast surprise of all his team mates, instead of
carrying out the play, he allowed his arm to
drop to shoot the ball at last far and high,
curving away toward a spot where no one
was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch that ball!&rdquo; These words were
on Rabbit&rsquo;s lips. He did not say them. Nor
was there any need, for as it reached the highest
spot in its long, broad curve, with a boom
like a cannon shot, the ball burst.</p>
<p>A sudden cry of surprise rose from the
bleachers. But from one pair of lips&mdash;Rabbit
heard it distinctly&mdash;there came, &ldquo;Ha! Ha! Big
joke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who had said it? Rabbit&rsquo;s gaze from face
to face of the opposing team came to rest
upon the big right tackle. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he assured
himself, &ldquo;he said that. And it was his toe that
pushed the ball into the crowd a moment ago.
Something queer there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>Though the boy thought all this, not one
word, for the moment, did he say to his team
mates. The whole affair puzzled him greatly.
Why had he changed his mind so quickly?
Why had he thrown the ball for that long
forward pass into the great nowhere? Had he
known the ball would burst? Well, scarcely
that. It had all been very strange. The ball
had been cold like ice. He had imagined that
he felt it swelling. He had acted, perhaps, on
instinct. Who knows?</p>
<p>But no more of that. Here was a new ball.
The whistle was blowing. No time, this, for
dreaming. Hillcrest must win. Just must!
They had lost the week before. The score now
stood at a tie. Twenty yards from a touchdown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on now boys!&rdquo; Dave Powers urged.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get in there and win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dave,&rdquo; Rabbit whispered, &ldquo;Dave, send me
through their right tackle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fellow!&rdquo; Dave stared. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll smear
you. He&rsquo;s twice your size.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try it!&rdquo; Rabbit was pleading now. &ldquo;Third
down! Please, Dave&mdash;try it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>In the huddle Dave gave his orders quickly.
Rabbit was to take the ball through right
tackle. His team mates gasped but said never
a word.</p>
<p>Rabbit&rsquo;s fingers trembled as they touched
the ground, prepared for the play, but in his
eye was a strange gleam.</p>
<p>Snap! The ball hit his hands. He was
away. Guard and tackle on his team did their
bit. It was not enough. As he leaped at the
opposing line, the big tackle blocked his path.
Then Rabbit did a strange thing. Coming to
a dead halt he said in a low, tense tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! Ha! Big joke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next instant he plunged head on. He
struck that big tackle. He brushed him aside
like a bag of straw, then plunged forward for
a clean gain of nine yards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Made it! Made it! Made it!&rdquo; chanted the
Hillcrest rooters. &ldquo;First down. Ten to go!
We want a touchdown! We want a touchdown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again!&rdquo; Rabbit panted, as he came up to
Dave. &ldquo;Just one more time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more time it is,&rdquo; Dave grinned. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
see how you did it, but it&rsquo;s worth one more
try.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>Again it was. Same play, same old forward
plunge, same results. This time Rabbit did
not say it all, only &ldquo;Ha! Ha!&rdquo; then he plunged.
Again the jinx worked. This time he went all
the way for a touchdown.</p>
<p>Amid the deafening din made by rooters,
Punch Dickman kicked the goal and the score
stood 14-7 in Hillcrest&rsquo;s favor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Game&rsquo;s not over,&rdquo; Dave warned his team
mates. &ldquo;Not by a long mile. And we&rsquo;ve got to
win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Johnny whispered to himself as he
heard the words, &ldquo;They must win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was thinking at that moment, however,
more of Ballard than of all the rest of the team.
Ballard, he knew, had been practicing entirely
too hard. He was nervous and jumpy. If too
much of the game depended upon him, he
might do something rather terrible. He knew
little about the strange events that were throwing
the game, almost entirely, to Rabbit&rsquo;s side
of the team. He was thankful it was so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only Ballard can get through a game
without any mishaps,&rdquo; he said to Jensie. &ldquo;And
if he can see his own team win, it will help a
lot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jensie agreed soberly, &ldquo;it will.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>&ldquo;Dave,&rdquo; Rabbit whispered, as they marched
down the field for the kick-off. &ldquo;That football
did not just burst. It was blown up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blown up!&rdquo; Dave stared. &ldquo;How could it
be? How could you blow up a football that&rsquo;s
been constantly in play for a half hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It went into the bleachers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And came right out again. Rabbit, you&rsquo;re
crazy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Rabbit, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not. That big tackle
knew all about it. That secret knowledge made
him soft. I went right through him twice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twice. That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Dave whistled low.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the queerest thing I ever heard. How
could they? And why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wanted to get our goat maybe. Perhaps
it&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;d call a practical joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And look!&rdquo; Rabbit pulled at Dave&rsquo;s arm.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re taking that big tackle out, putting in
another man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Dave grinned, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t go through
him if he&rsquo;s out of the game.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>This was true. The full force of its truth
came over the Hillcrest team as during the
moments that followed, they battled to hold
their lead.</p>
<p>Through a series of line plunges and end
runs, Chehalis pushed them back, back, back
to their own three yard line. Then the Chehalis
quarter-back fumbled and Dave retrieved the
ball.</p>
<p>This gave Hillcrest a short breathing spell.
Then again disaster descended upon them.
Rabbit fumbled the ball. It shot high in air.
A Chehalis man caught it and carried it across
for a touchdown. The goal was kicked. The
score was tied. The grandstands became places
of wild pandemonium. Then the whistle blew
for the end of the third quarter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rabbit,&rdquo; Dave whispered as they dropped
down upon the grass for a moment&rsquo;s rest,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re thinking too much about that busted
football. Perhaps that&rsquo;s what they wanted.
Anyway we must not. We&rsquo;ve got to get in and
win! Win! That&rsquo;s what!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we will,&rdquo; Rabbit exclaimed beneath
his breath. &ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like
to know how&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you go!&rdquo; Dave laughed. &ldquo;Forget it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet Rabbit could not quite forget it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>With the score standing at a tie the teams
settled down to a grimly fought fourth quarter.
Chehalis attempted two line plunges, and
one end run. Failing to make their downs, they
kicked.</p>
<p>Hillcrest caught the kick, carried the ball to
their own forty yard line, tried a line plunge, a
forward pass and an end run, then kicked. So
for ten minutes struggling, sweating, racing,
plunging, all to no purpose, they beat their way
back and forth across the field.</p>
<p>With five minutes left to play, Chehalis
fought their way to Hillcrest&rsquo;s twenty yard
line. There for three downs they stuck. Then,
like a flash out of the blue, from his position
behind the line of scrimmage, the Chehalis
full-back booted the ball straight over the bar
for a field goal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three ahead,&rdquo; someone groaned as play
was resumed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing like that,&rdquo; Rabbit retorted. &ldquo;Four
minutes left to play. Touchdown! Touchdown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the bleachers were chanting: &ldquo;Touchdown!
Touchdown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The struggle was resumed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>Time out for Chehalis. A player limped off
the field. By this time Rabbit was too weary
to see who replaced him. Soon he was to know
and smile.</p>
<p>Once again play was resumed; Hillcrest&rsquo;s
ball on the opponent&rsquo;s forty yard line.</p>
<p>They went into a huddle! Came out. The
play called for two short lateral passes behind
the line. While this was going on Rabbit was
to break through the opponent&rsquo;s scattered defense
and prepare to receive a long pass.</p>
<p>Could he make it? He breathed hard. Snap!
They were away. So was Rabbit. To reach his
required position was easy. Where was the
ball? Had the two laterals served their purpose?
Yes! Yes! Here came the ball, straight
for his outstretched hands and not an opponent
near. What luck!</p>
<p>But wait! As he caught the ball and turned
to run, he saw before him, not ten yards away,
a huge player, in fact, none other than that
right tackle, the one he suspected of some unfair
trick. He had been returned to the game.</p>
<p>There are times when Rabbit&rsquo;s mind works
with the speed of a steel trap. This was one of
those times.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>Speeding straight at his opponent, he held
the ball straight out before him, at the same
time hissing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! Take it! It might blow up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a space of seconds the big would-be
tackler halted in his tracks. The expression on
his face was a study.</p>
<p>As for Rabbit, he stopped short, pivoted to
the right, flashed by his opponent to speed
away and across the line for a touchdown.
Hillcrest went into the lead.</p>
<p>In the last two minutes of play, Chehalis
made a desperate attempt to score. Two forward
passes were knocked down. An end run
was blocked, a third forward pass was intercepted.
Hillcrest marched down the field for
a gain of twenty yards. Then the whistle blew.
Hillcrest had won!</p>
<p>There followed the usual wild applause and
the hearty congratulations, then Dave and
Rabbit sauntered toward the exit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you it&rsquo;s nonsense!&rdquo; Dave burst out.
&ldquo;Under such circumstances you just couldn&rsquo;t
blow up that football. Suppose it was full of
gasoline or gun powder, how would you light
it? I tell you it&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is,&rdquo; Rabbit laughed. &ldquo;It happened
all the same. And I haven&rsquo;t got a single
theory about how they did it. One thing is
sure, Dave, the ball was cold, cold as ice. I&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! There&rsquo;s something under the bleachers,
something shiny&mdash;dollar maybe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; he said a moment later, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a football
pump. And look! What a fat one it is!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sayee!&rdquo; he stopped and stared. &ldquo;This is the
very spot! The ball went into the bleachers
right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Johnny Thompson came up
to them. Jensie and Ballard had gone off the
field. Ballard was happy, he had played in a
successful football game. True, he had been
given no very important part in it, this he
knew, was more or less a matter of chance.
Next time,&mdash;well, anyway, he had on this day
made no serious breaks. The future might take
care of itself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>Johnny, however, was not thinking of Ballard
at that moment. He was turning that
strange air pump over and over in his hands.
It was, he saw, a very ordinary pump, over
which had been soldered an outer casing. The
space between the pump and the casing was
padded with asbestos. &ldquo;As if the pump might
get too hot,&rdquo; he said to Dave as, assisted by
Rabbit, Dave told what they knew of the
strange occurrence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still about this,&rdquo; Johnny counseled at
last. &ldquo;The crowd thought the ball just naturally
blew up; that happens, you know. Let
them think it. We&rsquo;ll get at the bottom of this
mystery yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strangely enough, as often happens, this
mystery was closely related to another and,
had Johnny but known it, the solution of one
would go far toward untangling the other.</p>

<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br />THE &ldquo;GHOST&rdquo; WALKS AGAIN</h2>
<p>That night the &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; walked again&mdash;that
is, Panther Eye returned. It was late,
how late Johnny did not quite know. He was
seated beside the great, wood-burning stove
in the great front room of the Blue Moon.</p>
<p>The crowd was gone. And what a crowd it
had been, a merry mob of college folks celebrating
a football game. Yells, songs, wild,
fantastic dances and eats, lots of eats, and
good, hot drinks, that was what the long evening
had been. The Blue Moon was a success,
a howling success. As he sat there in the half-darkness&mdash;one
dim light shone in a far corner&mdash;Johnny
was in a mellow mood.</p>
<p>And then, without a sound, the door opened.
There came the shuffling of feet. Johnny
caught the pale gleam of two balls of fire.
&ldquo;Pant&rsquo;s eyes,&rdquo; he whispered with an involuntary
shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Johnny, I&rsquo;m back,&rdquo; came in a hoarse
whisper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, yourself,&rdquo; Johnny was on his feet.
&ldquo;Wait. The coffee&rsquo;s still hot. There are mince
pies, the turnover sort you can hold in your
hands. I&rsquo;ll be back in a flash.&rdquo; He was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pant,&rdquo; Johnny leaned forward eagerly as
his strange visitor finished his last bite of pie.
&ldquo;Last time I saw you, you were telling me of
a beautiful valley in Ethiopia and something
about a girl, perhaps a white girl, you didn&rsquo;t
seem to know. You said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Pant gave forth a low, hollow
chuckle. &ldquo;Yes, Johnny, that was strange and&mdash;and
exciting too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he settled back in his chair, his
unusual eyes half closed. &ldquo;That girl was
watching a small herd of cattle. They don&rsquo;t
have fences in Ethiopia, at least, not in most
places. So there was the girl and her cattle,
the green pasture like a magnificent oriental
carpet, and the small house set among the
palms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was warm, midafternoon. I sat down on
a fallen tree to rest myself and to just&mdash;well
sort of enjoy that beautiful picture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I must have fallen asleep&mdash;&rdquo; suddenly
Pant&rsquo;s eyes opened very wide. He went
through the preliminary motions of springing
to his feet. &ldquo;Yes, I MUST have fallen asleep
for, of a sudden, I heard a most unearthly
scream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sprang to my feet just in time to see a
huge, dark-faced man leap into the brush.
And, Johnny,&rdquo; Pant drew in a long breath, &ldquo;he
was carrying something on his back, carrying
it like a sack of oats. He was carrying that
girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-oo,&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite common, that sort of thing there
in Ethiopia,&rdquo; Pant went on more quietly. &ldquo;You
see, Johnny, they still have slaves in Ethiopia,
perhaps a million or two, no one seems to
know exactly. And if you&rsquo;re to sell slaves, you
must steal them. That&rsquo;s what this fellow was
doing. Probably he was a Mohammedan, most
of them are, a pretty low-lived lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny began eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Johnny&mdash;&rdquo; again the low, hollow
chuckle, &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t any of my business, not
really. I hadn&rsquo;t come there to reform the country.
I just wanted to see what it was like and
to hunt up my brother. But this fellow, that
big, dark-faced man with a hooked nose, I
learned about the nose later, that fellow had
spoiled my picture&mdash;you know, the girl, the
cattle, the carpet of green, the jewel of a house.
It was all spoiled after he had taken the girl.
I wanted that girl back in the picture. So&mdash;natur&mdash;ally&mdash;&rdquo;
Pant&rsquo;s voice dropped to a
drawl, &ldquo;I went after him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pant,&rdquo; exclaimed Johnny, &ldquo;you are queer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been told,&rdquo; Pant grinned
broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you went after him,&rdquo; Johnny prompted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I followed him. And that was the
longest bit of following I&rsquo;ve ever done. That
man, with the girl on his back, kept me coming
along at a good pace for hours and hours.
Didn&rsquo;t even stop for dark, just marched on
and on. Must have known every step of the
way. And I&mdash;there I was pussy-footing along,
expecting every minute to have him whirl
about and drop me with the young cannon of
a revolver he had slung from his belt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t carry a weapon, Johnny, just a big
pocket knife, that&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;d left my light rifle
at a bamboo shack in the jungle. I figured that
the night, darkness, and that fellow&rsquo;s falling
asleep was my only chance. And here he was
marching on and on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Might as well give it up,&rsquo; I told myself,
&lsquo;he&rsquo;ll be breaking into a clearing before long,&mdash;into
a whole village of his sort. Then what
will be the good?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was really about ready to give up when
the fellow turned abruptly to the right, went
staggering up a stiff slope for maybe a thousand
feet, then vanished, just vanished&mdash;&rdquo;
Pant paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a cave,&rdquo; Johnny breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cave,&rdquo; Pant nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what you wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just that&mdash;&rdquo; Pant nodded once more.</p>
<p>At that instant, through the half open window
there came the high shrill note of a whistle&mdash;just
such a night call as Johnny had once
heard in the heart of a jungle at midnight.</p>
<p>Pant sprang to his feet. He went gliding to
a window. There, crouching low, he peered
through a crack beneath the drawn shade out
into the night. He remained thus while the
clock ticked off three full minutes, then, without
a word of explanation, resumed his place
by the stove.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he went on exactly where he had
left off, &ldquo;he had taken that girl into the cave.
He was armed, I was not. I could see in the
dark, he could not. But probably he had
matches. Most likely he&rsquo;d make a fire. I had
to have that girl back for my picture there at
the edge of the jungle. Besides&mdash;&rdquo; Pant paused
to stare at the floor, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like slavery. Do
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one does, Pant, at least no one but
those who keep slaves or make a business of
selling them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it!&rdquo; Pant agreed. &ldquo;So of course
I had to rescue that girl. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong,
Johnny. I&rsquo;m no romancer. Not a bit of it. But
I had to get that girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For your picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He fell asleep&mdash;that man. I crept into the
cave. The girl was there unharmed. Terribly
frightened, of course. Bound hand and foot.
I should have killed him, that slave-snatching
son of Ali. But to try that would have been
dangerous. Besides I hate corpses. Don&rsquo;t you,
Johnny? Can&rsquo;t seem to forget &rsquo;em ever. Remember
that man in the mine back there in
Russia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never forgot how he looked, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you carried the girl away and that was
all of it?&rdquo; Johnny relaxed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Once more Pant was on the prowl.
Springing to his feet, he wandered like a cat
looking for a mouse all over the place. Then
he came back and sat down. &ldquo;That,&rdquo; he went
on, &ldquo;was only the beginning. You&rsquo;d be surprised,
Johnny, you really would. Perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
he spoke slowly, &ldquo;perhaps, you won&rsquo;t believe
the rest of it. I&mdash;I guess I better not tell you.
It&rsquo;s too&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s voice rose. &ldquo;Go on.
Tell it all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t easy&mdash;&rdquo; Pant went on at last in
a slow drawl, &ldquo;to find the way back over the
way we came, in fact, it was impossible. I
tried to remember the way we had come. But
you know the jungle, Johnny, vines that trip
you and thorny bushes that turn you back.
Rough and rugged it was too, great rocks here
and deep ravines there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl found it difficult to walk, she&rsquo;d
been bound for hours. I helped her along until
she showed me she could go it alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Strange sort of girl, that one, Johnny. Never
said a word&mdash;just marched straight on behind
me. Perhaps she didn&rsquo;t know my language.
Quite surely she didn&rsquo;t. Think of the
languages spoken in Africa&mdash;French, Dutch,
Italian, German, and all the black lingos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We marched on for hours,&rdquo; Pant heaved
a heavy sigh. &ldquo;All the time I was looking for
the way back. I found a river I&rsquo;d seen. Then,
in passing around a rocky barrier, I lost it. All
I could do was to make sure we were going
down, not up. That would take us toward valleys.
What valleys? Who could tell?</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the time I was thinking of the girl.
Was she all white or only one of those white-blacks
they call albino. And what did she
think of me? Perhaps she thought me one
more slave trader who had stolen her from this
big fellow with the hooked nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; Pant sat up quite suddenly, his
strange eyes gleaming, his tone mysterious.
&ldquo;Johnny, did you ever see a man in one place,
just see him a time or two, not know him very
well&mdash;and then, weeks later did you think you
saw him again in a different place thousands of
miles away where he couldn&rsquo;t very well be?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Johnny grinned. &ldquo;There are some
things that have never happened to me. That&rsquo;s
one of them. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;oh nothing,&rdquo; Pant settled back.
&ldquo;About this girl now. It was queer, Johnny,
downright queer. We&rsquo;d come to the top of a
high ridge. Dawn had come, as it always does
in the tropics, with a rush and with the joyous
scream of a thousand birds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We stood there on the ridge looking down
at a sort of barren plateau when some baboons,
a whole troop of them, came marching out
from the jungle. Huge fellows they were.
Powerful beasts with arms a foot longer than
mine. Powerful? Johnny, one of them could
have grabbed me and broken every bone in
my body. But they wouldn&rsquo;t, Johnny, I knew
that well enough. Once, for a whole week, I&rsquo;d
lived in such a place, just to watch them. If I
met one on the trail he&rsquo;d try to bluff me. He&rsquo;d
march straight at me swinging his huge fists
and cracking his teeth as if he meant to tear
me to bits. When he was twenty feet away
he&rsquo;d stop dead in his tracks. Then I&rsquo;d laugh
at him, laugh big and loud. And the poor old
fellow would turn and go slouching away like
some huge bully who&rsquo;s been running a bluff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, they wouldn&rsquo;t harm us, Johnny, those
baboons, but they were interesting to watch.
They played a sort of ball game with a cocoanut,
tossing it about. They did the leap-frog
act better than any boys you&rsquo;ve ever seen.
They had just seated themselves in a circle for
some other game, when all of a sudden, a sound
from the jungle startled them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A shot, Johnny, a shot fired close at hand!
You may think I wasn&rsquo;t startled. That big boy
with the hooked nose was my first thought.
I dragged the girl into the fronds of a low
growing palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t the big fellow with the hooked
nose, Johnny. Worse than that.&rdquo; Pant rose to
take one more prowl about the room. &ldquo;Wild
men, Johnny, a whole troop of them! And
were they wild! Such faces! Such bodies!
Such weapons!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scared, Johnny? Of course I was scared.
All these wild men hate whites. All whites
looked the same to them. One glimpse of my
face and the face of the girl! That&rsquo;s all that
would be needed. They&rsquo;d get us, those wild
men. Worse than a whole drove of those little
tropical pigs, these wild men were. They&rsquo;d
sure get us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I looked around for some place to hide.
Then I glanced back where the wild men were.
I saw right away they had troubles of their
own. They were looking back and scurrying
for shelter all at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody was after them. We were close
to the border. Had they been on a raid? Were
whites after them or some other black men?
There wasn&rsquo;t time to settle that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gripping the girl by the wrist, I led her
back among the bushes, then along the ridge
a short distance. And what do you think I
saw, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&mdash;can&rsquo;t guess,&rdquo; Johnny stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cave, Johnny, a perfectly good cave.
Wouldn&rsquo;t believe it would you? Well, you&rsquo;ll
not believe what happened after that&mdash;you
couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Pant,&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s voice was low, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
believe it if you say it&rsquo;s true. Couldn&rsquo;t be any
stranger than the things that happened to us
up there on Behring Straits in Russia.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seem that they could be,&rdquo; Pant rumbled
down deep in his throat. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be surprised,
Johnny. Downright surprised. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant broke short off to sit staring at the
window. The shade was drawn. Only one
small light was turned on. This left the window
in deep shadows. The light from a street
lamp was brighter than the light from within.
The wind was blowing, tossing tree branches
about. Like ghostly fingers, these branches
traced strange moving patterns on the shade.</p>
<p>Johnny was shocked by the change that had
come over his companion&rsquo;s face. Lips parted,
nostrils wide, eyes aglow with strange fire, he
sat there staring as if entranced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the shadow of tossing branches,&rdquo;
Johnny said reassuringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Johnny,&rdquo; Pant&rsquo;s voice sounded hollow,
&ldquo;No, Johnny, that was not all. Excuse me,
Johnny. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got to go.&rdquo; Next instant without
a sound the boy was gone.</p>
<p>Then Johnny, staring once more at the curtain
saw, for an instant only, a pair of massive
shoulders, a giant head, a strangely hooked
nose&mdash;all this appeared in dark silhouette on
the window shade. One instant it was there,
the next it was gone. Only the eerie, wind-traced
tossing shadows were left.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>For a full five minutes Johnny sat there
staring. At last, with a heavy sigh, he arose
to go.</p>
<p>Once again, as he snapped off the light, then
for a period of seconds, stood in the doorway,
as on that other night, he was seized with a
strange notion, that Pant had not been there,
only his ghost; that the strange boy had been
killed over there in Ethiopia&mdash;his spirit returned
to haunt his friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true I
didn&rsquo;t touch him but ghosts don&rsquo;t eat mince
pie.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X</span>
<br />KENTUCKY&rsquo;S DOWNFALL</h2>
<p>The change from the shadows of the Blue
Moon and the weird whispers of Panther
Eye to the low roar of Dave&rsquo;s boiler room and
Dave&rsquo;s own low rumbling voice was almost
startling. Dave was real, and quite human,
the heating plant, made up as it was of bricks
and pipes, pumps and boilers, was about the
most substantial thing in the world. No
spooks here.</p>
<p>In this place for six hours every day Dave
reigned as king. He had come to love that
room as some people love their homes. The
mild, clean air, made pure by the constant
breathing in of those twin boilers, brought
unconscious joy to his heart. The low hiss of
steam, the faint roar of the fires on the grates,
the quish-quash of the pumps, were music to
his ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>To his nicely tuned ears, every sound had
a meaning. If the hiss of steam increased, if
a pump bumped ever so softly, if the fire&rsquo;s
low roar sank to a whisper, he was on his
feet. His hands grasped a shovel, a valve, or
a wrench and in a trice all was right again.</p>
<p>More than this, the old heating plant stood
for a very definite change in his life. The
moment he stepped through those doors and
good old John MacQueen said, &ldquo;Your work
will be this. You will do it this way and that
way,&rdquo; he had become important both to himself
and to others. He was a worker.</p>
<p>He loved to sit there, with the green shaded
light gleaming low, with the shadows leaping
among the pumps and the pipes, and picture
the rooms in those other buildings. In
the gym, all aglow with light, a practice game
of basketball was in progress. Soon the players
would go bounding down the stairs to the
showers. In the old brown stone building
across the way, Prexy, in his office, dictated
letters, in another room the treasurer
thumbed his ledgers. Far up beneath the
rafters were bat-roosts where a score or more
of boys bent over tables reading intently, or
figuring feverishly. In the red brick &ldquo;dorm,&rdquo;
at the far corner of the campus, more than a
hundred girls garbed in lounging pajamas,
kimonos, or more formal garb, were studying.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All these,&rdquo; he would think with a smile,
and a glad tug at his heart, &ldquo;are warm and
comfortable on a damp and chilly night, because
I am here watching these old furnaces
and listening to that hiss of steam. I am part
of a big thing. I am a worker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, yes, what more could any boy ask, a
chance to study, to listen to the talk of men
older and wiser than himself and then to do
his part in making all this possible for many
others.</p>
<p>Did Dave think of this often? Probably
not. His head was full of forward passes, lateral
passes, touchdowns, college algebra,
chemical formulae, and all the rest that made
up his life. For all that it was good at times
just to sit there listening and thinking, just
thinking and listening&mdash;nothing more.</p>
<p>A sturdy, cheerful, independent lot were
these Hillcrest boys who worked their way.
And there were scores of them. On the football
team there was Stagger Weed, who tended
a string of furnaces; Rabbit Jones, who
swept a dozen floors every day; Punch Dickman,
who was a hash slinger at the Golden
Gate, and many others, happy warriors all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy, Johnny! How&rsquo;s things?&rdquo; Dave
greeted as Johnny came in blinking from the
light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine, Dave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Blue Moon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful, Dave.&rdquo; Johnny dropped into
a chair beside Dave&rsquo;s small desk. &ldquo;Dave, how&rsquo;s
football?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw how it was Saturday,&rdquo; Dave
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s brow wrinkled, &ldquo;you
didn&rsquo;t use my good pal, Kentucky, very
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o,&rdquo; Dave spoke slowly, &ldquo;we didn&rsquo;t.
He&rsquo;s trying too hard. Have to let him slow
down a bit. But he&rsquo;s a fine kid, Johnny, a
mighty fine kid. I like to see him run. Wait
until next Friday. You know we play on Friday
this week, Naperville&rsquo;s request. You&rsquo;ll
see a thing or two. Just you wait!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>Johnny was willing enough to wait if Dave
felt that way about it. He did wait. He did
see things, wonderful things for a while&mdash;and
then&mdash;well&mdash;yes, and then.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Dave&rsquo;s tone was low, tense with
emotion. &ldquo;We gotta&rsquo; beat that Naperville
gang. We just got to. And we can do it, Old
Kentucky.&rdquo; He placed a hand affectionately
on the mountain boy&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>The great day had come. The Naperville
game was about to start. Never before had
there been such crowds, so much color, enthusiasm,
and cheering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can do it,&rdquo; Dave went on, &ldquo;just you
and I. No one can dodge the way you can.
And I&mdash;I&rsquo;m a battering ram. I&rsquo;m good! I
even admit it,&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go through
&rsquo;em. You follow on and make the gains.
We&rsquo;re going to have a touchdown two minutes
after the first whistle. I&rsquo;ll tell you how,&rdquo;
his voice dropped to a mere whisper. &ldquo;Artie
will give you the ball. I&rsquo;ll hit their tackle, hit
him hard and ram their line into a heap. That
makes a hole. You go through, far as ever
you can.&rdquo; He drew a long breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; Kentucky asked in a low, quiet
drawl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Same thing. Four times running,&rdquo; was
Dave&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;Every time we&rsquo;ll gain a little
less ground. Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if you&rsquo;d be
thrown for a loss on the fourth. There&rsquo;s a
bright sophomore on that Naperville team&mdash;too
bright. Plays right guard. He&rsquo;ll break
through and smear you. Let him!&rdquo; Dave
chuckled. &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; another long breath,
&ldquo;then Artie will send you through the spot
where that same right guard belongs. He&rsquo;ll
be feeling so happy about smearing you, he
won&rsquo;t be watching, or if he is, he&rsquo;ll expect
that same play. You should get through, all
the way through, kid! Make it a touchdown,
boy. Make it a touchdown.&rdquo; He wrung the
younger boy&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the horn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who can say what went on inside the Kentucky
boy&rsquo;s mind as he crouched behind the
line waiting for the snapping of the ball? As
yet all was quite new and strange to him.
They expected so much of him. They wanted
him to beat this Naperville team. Naperville
meant nothing to him. But to his team mates
and all the old grads, the letter men of other
years, it meant a great deal.</p>
<p>But here was the ball. He felt its hard
smoothness in his hand, saw Dave plunge forward
to send a player crashing to one side,
saw the opening and went through for a gain
of a yard, two, three, four, eight yards. Then
a bolt of lightning appeared to hit him and he
went to earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>The instant the whistle blew, he felt Dave&rsquo;s
hands on his shoulder, helping him to his
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grand, Old Kentucky! Better&rsquo;n I expected.
Now make it a first down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A first down it was. The crowd on the
bleachers screamed its approval. The boy
could hear them shouting: &ldquo;Na&mdash;per&mdash;ville!
Na&mdash;per&mdash;ville! Beat &rsquo;em! Beat &rsquo;em! Smear
&rsquo;em! Smash &rsquo;em! Kill &rsquo;em!&rdquo; The shout, coming
in slow motion at first, picked up speed
until it sounded like an on-rushing train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady, boy!&rdquo; Dave warned. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t expect
too much. Remember!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll remember,&rdquo; Kentucky&rsquo;s breath came
short and quick.</p>
<p>There was need to remember, for on the second
down he failed to gain and on the third
he was thrown for a loss of two yards. It was
at this moment that the mountain boy became
conscious of that Naperville guard. He was
not only a smart boy, he had a mean turn to
his nature. He leered as if to say, &ldquo;Ha! Ha!
Big joke! Smeared you, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>Ballard&rsquo;s face was a mask as he took his
place for the next play. Then, as he received
the ball, he faked that same line plunge, saw
that leering guard leave his place, then, like
a flash of fire, shot to the right, through that
opening and away.</p>
<p>Then a strange thing happened to his mind.
As a player flashed past him, he was to him no
longer a player, but old Nicodemus, the Colonel&rsquo;s
ram. And now here was another off to
his right. Oh, well! offer him a hip, then fade.
He faded down the field. To the left a third
Nicodemus appeared. He too was dodged.
But here he was now straight ahead of him,
not Nicodemus, of course, but the Naperville&rsquo;s
safety man, all that remained between him and
a touchdown.</p>
<p>With a friendly grin, holding the ball
straight out before him, the Kentucky boy
sprang straight at the waiting giant.</p>
<p>Thrown off his guard, the giant reached for
the ball. But, of a sudden, the ball was not
there. Stopping dead in his tracks, Kentucky
had pivoted sharply to the right and was away
for that touchdown.</p>
<p>Then how the bleachers roared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;See! I told you,&rdquo; Dave grinned as he came
up with the Kentucky boy. &ldquo;Two minutes to a
touchdown, exactly by the watch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kentucky did not laugh. He did not even
smile. Strangely enough, at that moment he
was seeing a face, an unfriendly, leering face,
the face of Naperville&rsquo;s right guard. A chill
shook his slender frame. He wanted to plead
with the coach. Strange as it may seem, he
wanted to be taken out of the game. &ldquo;But how
foolish!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;What reason could I
give?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not quit the game. He played on, but
ever and again, as there was time-out and he
lay flat upon the ground relaxed, with eyes
closed, he seemed to see that leering face and
always it caused him to shudder.</p>
<p>After their brilliant start, the team slowed
down a bit. The quarter ended without another
touchdown.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, Naperville took the
ball and, for the most part, kept it. With the
dogged determination of a slow, heavy team,
they at last pounded their way across the
field to a touchdown. Since both teams had
made good on kicks, the score was now tied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>But not for long. Hillcrest went into the
air. The grilling practice of that week did not
go for nothing. Three times their forward
passes were complete. It was a short lateral
caught by Kentucky and hurled high and wide
to Dave that at last scored their second touchdown
of the game. The kick was good.</p>
<p>Then again came tough going. The Hillcrest
team was tiring. Like shock troops, a
half dozen husky subs were pushed into the
Naperville team and again they battered their
way across the field and over the goal. The
kick was good. Once again the score was tied.</p>
<p>Then came the five last tense moments of
the game. Even faces in the grandstand were
drawn into hard fixed lines. Men were there,
stout, gray haired men, who, in their day, had
gone romping over their ancient enemy to victory.
Now they wanted that victory once
again, wanted it terribly. True, there was one
more game scheduled with this team, but every
game counted, every game! There was no
time like the golden now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smash that line!&rdquo; they chanted. &ldquo;Smash
that line! Smash that line!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>As they went into a huddle, Dave muttered
to his team: &ldquo;Remember what we did in the
beginning? They&rsquo;ve forgotten by now. Same
play, all the way through, except just three
plunges through left tackle, then one through
right guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hillcrest&rsquo;s ball on the enemy&rsquo;s thirty-yard
line. Four minutes to play. First down, ten
to go.</p>
<p>Snap! The ball fairly cracked as it reached
Kentucky&rsquo;s hands. Dave broke a wide opening.
Kentucky went through to a first down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Break that line! Break that line! Smash
&rsquo;em! Smash &rsquo;em! Smash &rsquo;em!&rdquo; the bleachers
chanted.</p>
<p>Kentucky passed his hand before his eyes&mdash;that
leering sophomore was there again.</p>
<p>Now he was off once again for a gain of six
yards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it a first down!&rdquo; Dave muttered
grimly.</p>
<p>From the enemy&rsquo;s bleachers there came a
mighty roar: &ldquo;Stop that man! Stop that man!
Kill him! Kill him!&rdquo; Dave knew they meant
him. He grinned broadly. A moment more
and he was laughing, for the bruised and battered
tackle of the opposing team straightened
up to shout back to the now silent bleachers:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stop him yourself! He ain&rsquo;t no man! He&rsquo;s
a stick of flaming red dynamite!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red dynamite!&rdquo; The Hillcrest bleachers
caught the words and hurled it back. &ldquo;Red
dynamite! Red dynamite! &rsquo;Ray for Red Dynamite!&rdquo;
And so, in a flash, Dave was named for
life.</p>
<p>They did not make it a first down, not that
time, for, as if he had rehearsed the act, that
grinning, leering guard broke through once
more and threw Ballard for a loss. As he did
so, he hissed some words in the mountain boy&rsquo;s
ears. Kentucky heard it but indistinctly. Even
so, his blood raced. His fingers itched for action.
As he rose, he stood there like a marble
statue, white and cold.</p>
<p>The next play came with the speed of
thought and, like a radio flash, was executed.
Kentucky went straight through the place
left by the leering guard. It looked like a
touchdown. But no, he was thrown hard, just
one yard from the goal line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a break!&rdquo; Dave exulted. &ldquo;First down
and a yard to a touchdown!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>The crowd saw it all and went into hysterics.
Hats soared high. Girls screamed. An
old grad fell backward off the bleachers, barely
escaping a broken neck. The bleachers were
a riot.</p>
<p>But what was this? Players on both teams
leaped into action. They began piling up, pulling
and hauling. When it was all over, Ballard,
white faced and panting, was dragged
from the bottom of the heap.</p>
<p>There had been a fight going on beneath
that pile. Kentucky and that leering Naperville
guard had been at it tooth and nail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was cho&mdash;choking me!&rdquo; the Naperville
guard gasped. &ldquo;He&mdash;he nearly killed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened, Ballard?&rdquo; the coach asked,
crowding in.</p>
<p>The Kentucky boy made no reply. He was
white as marble and shaking like a leaf. He
turned, pushed his way through his own team
and walked unsteadily to the bench to drop
upon it like a sack of sand.</p>
<p>A hush fell over the throng. The referees
conferred. There was nothing for it, whatever
the cause, the Kentucky boy had started a
fight. Fifteen yards penalty for Hillcrest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>Less than two minutes to play and sixteen
yards to a touchdown. Hillcrest lost heart.
Four downs and only four yards gained. Naperville
took the ball. They booted it down the
field. The whistle blew. The game was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a tie,&rdquo; came a murmur from the
bleachers. &ldquo;Only a tie and we might have
won.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a tie and we might have won,&rdquo; the
words were taken up by more than one player.
But Ballard, Old Kentucky as they had lovingly
called him, such a short time before, did
not hear. He was not there. He was far away,
how far no one seemed to know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br />A RIDE IN THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>An hour later Johnny Thompson found the
Kentucky boy sitting in a chair beside
the range in the cook room of the Blue Moon.
He was all crumpled up like a rag doll and
still shaking like a leaf in the wind. Once,
when Johnny was in Central American jungles,
he saw a monkey caught in a wire trap.
He too had been all crumpled up and trembling.
Ballard was like that. A great wave of
remorse swept over him. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t have
brought him up here,&rdquo; he told himself savagely.
&ldquo;Belongs down there in the mountains, he
does, down there where men are free as squirrels
or woodchucks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet, as he paused for sober thought, he
could not be sure. What should be done?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, why did you do it?&rdquo; he asked in a
voice that vibrated with kindness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t nobody call me no name like that,&rdquo;
the Kentucky boy grumbled without looking
up. &ldquo;Just can&rsquo;t nobody at all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So that sneering guard called him a vile
name!&rdquo; Johnny thought to himself. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a penalty for that too, but Kentucky didn&rsquo;t
know. Too bad! No good to tell him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What should be done? He was seized with
a sudden inspiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ballard,&rdquo; he spoke in as steady a tone as
he could command, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m driving back to the
mouth of Pounding Mill Creek for the week
end. Want to go along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ballard did not look up. He replied in a word
of one syllable: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Yet it is probable that
few spoken words have ever expressed so
much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. We&rsquo;ll start in an hour. With
luck, we&rsquo;ll be there in seven hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a boy, Johnny had a very long head.
There were many things he might have done.
He might have remonstrated with Ballard,
told him that in the mountains you could kill
a man for calling you the wrong kind of name,
but not in Hillcrest. He might have sympathized
with him, might have said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get
even with that Naperville mob.&rdquo; The thing he
did could not have been more right, had he
been advised by a score of older heads.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>When at last they started, there were three
in the car instead of two. He had run across
Jensie. She had insisted on going along. The
car seat was wide. Johnny was not slow in
accepting her challenge. So, with an hour of
sunlight and many hours of glorious moonlight
before them, they took the long, broad,
winding trail that leads south.</p>
<p>Mile after mile sped by and not a word was
said by anyone. They are strangely quiet people,
these mountain folks&mdash;yet there are times
when they appear to speak without saying any
words. Their very silence speaks for them.
Johnny had felt this many times. He was feeling
it now. Jensie seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
be too hard on him, Johnny. Don&rsquo;t let the boys
be too hard on him. It&rsquo;s our mountain ways.&rdquo;
And Ballard? He seemed to be saying, &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t go back. I&rsquo;ll never go back. I won&rsquo;t go
back,&rdquo; repeating it over and over. Strangely
enough, because of this repetition, Johnny felt
sure that in the end he would go back and he
was glad.</p>
<p>They came at last to the crest of Big Black
Mountain. There, without quite knowing why,
Johnny cut off the gas and allowed his car to
go rolling along to a gliding stop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>A second look told him why he had not gone
on. He had been stopped by the sheer beauty
of the scene that lay before them. Big Black
Mountain is not a peak, it is a tree-grown
ridge stretching away for miles and miles. To
right and left of it are other ridges, Little
Black Mountain, Stone Mountain, Pine Ridge,
and all the rest. These ridges, covered as they
were with the golden coat of autumn and
shone down upon by a matchless moon, made
a picture of breath-taking beauty. Jensie too
felt the glory of it all, Johnny knew, for he felt
her heart leap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s grand!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;And to
think! This is MY country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s voice was low with emotion,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s your country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he said this he was not thinking of Jensie,
but of Ballard, who sat motionless in the car,
saying nothing at all. This was HIS country.
What was he thinking now? Johnny would
have given a dollar to know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;His country,&rdquo; Johnny whispered to himself.
Along those ridges chestnuts and beechnuts
were falling. Squirrels were frisking about
on the ground. With a gun and a good hound-dog&mdash;Ballard
owned one of the best dogs in
the mountains&mdash;you could have a perfect, gloriously
golden day, hunting those squirrels and
keeping an ear open for the distant gobble-gobble
of some wild turkeys who might, just
might, be hiding in those hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a life!&rdquo; Johnny barely escaped saying
the words aloud. &ldquo;What a grand and glorious
life!&rdquo; Deep down in some hollow a fat
old coon was at this moment stealing corn.
Rabbits were frisking in the moonlight; Johnny
saw one go dashing across the road. Down
there, far below, was a two-room log cabin,
Ballard&rsquo;s home. In the narrow, coal-burning
grate, a low fire would be gleaming. Above
the mantel hung Ballard&rsquo;s rifle. Beside the fire
slept his favorite hound-dog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m going to ask him to give it up,&rdquo;
Johnny told himself. &ldquo;Going to tell him he
should go back to college, to books, to serving
coffee and hot dogs, and back to football. How
can I?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny touched the starter.
The car went purring down the slope. And yet&mdash;yes,
he would ask him. What if it was good
sport to wander the hills in search of game?
What if the mountains did call? What would
it get you in the end? With an untrained temper,
the rifle that sends a squirrel tumbling
over and over from the top of a tree might at
last be turned upon some human being. And
after that, long years in jail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; Johnny told himself soberly, &ldquo;is
what football&rsquo;s for, to teach a fellow to take it.
Not to take vile names. The referee will take
care of that, but to take a tumble, to be thrown,
thrown hard again and again, to be bumped
and bruised and still be able to smile. That&rsquo;s
football, a grand and glorious sport!&rdquo; Yes, he&rsquo;d
ask Ballard to go back. He MUST go back!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll get off here,&rdquo; Ballard broke in upon
Johnny&rsquo;s solemn meditations and high resolves.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a short cut through the hills.
I&rsquo;ll be home in a quarter of an hour.&rdquo; As Johnny
stopped the car, Ballard hopped out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Johnny! Thanks a powerful lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Ballard,&rdquo; Johnny called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Ballard,&rdquo; Jensie echoed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
be seeing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be seeing you,&rdquo; the hills echoed back.
Ballard was gone, swallowed up by darkness
and his beloved mountains.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>Jensie did not speak again until they were
before her own gate. Then she said quietly:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going hunting with Ballard in the morning,
Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he know it?&rdquo; Johnny asked in some
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but he will. It won&rsquo;t be the first time
we&rsquo;ve gone hunting together, nor, I hope, the
last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Johnny.&rdquo; She was out of the car
now. Her hand was on the gate. &ldquo;Thanks awfully
for bringing us down.&rdquo; Next moment
she too had vanished into the darkness.</p>
<p>For a moment Johnny sat in his car thinking.
Yes, these were strangely silent people.
Jensie had not asked him to go with them on
that hunting trip. She had given no reason for
not doing so. There was a reason. She expected
him to know the reason. He did&mdash;and
was glad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>As he drove on to Cousin Bill&rsquo;s place, he was
able to dismiss Ballard from his mind. He
thought of the old mill and its mystery, of
Donald Day and his grandfather, who was still
in the hospital. He thought of the young aviator
down in the valley who said he had found
a wonderful new fuel for his airplane motor.
Ballard had told him that this aviator had become
Donald Day&rsquo;s best customer. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
bought an old horse and wagon,&rdquo; Ballard had
said. &ldquo;Every day he comes up and carts away
three or four of those queer jugs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what&rsquo;s in those jugs,&rdquo; Johnny had
replied. &ldquo;Really, don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cross my heart,&rdquo; Ballard had answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to find out,&rdquo; Johnny had
said with determination. But would he? Well,
here he was at Cousin Bill&rsquo;s. Now for a few
winks of sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br />STRANGE WEALTH</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Want to come down with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It happened as simply as that.
Johnny Thompson caught his breath, breathed
hard twice, then said, &ldquo;Y&mdash;yes. Sure I would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy who had asked this surprising question
was none other than Donald Day, grandson
of the wizard of Stone Mountain who in
a mysterious manner managed to make something
of great value out of air and water alone.
It was the next day. Jensie and Ballard were
away in the hills with dog and guns but Johnny
and Donald were standing at the door leading
to the mystery room beneath the mill. The
key was in Donald&rsquo;s hand and he was saying
quietly, &ldquo;Want to come down&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if he does not know that his grandfather
kept the whole thing a secret?&rdquo; Johnny
thought to himself. &ldquo;Wonder if I should tell
him. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment little Bexter Brice burst
through the outer door. &ldquo;The worst things do
happen,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Poor old Uncle Mose
Short!&rdquo; He dropped down upon a rustic seat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; Johnny asked, for the
moment allowing his interest to be drawn from
the enthralling mystery below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know,&rdquo; Bex was speaking slowly
now, &ldquo;Mr. MacQueen always took a great deal
of interest in Mose. Mose is old, really old, no
one knows just how old, but he&rsquo;s been game.
He&rsquo;s worked. Times have been hard but all
he&rsquo;s asked is a chance to earn a poor sort of
living and now&mdash;&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;Now it looks
as if that chance would be cut off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he turned to the city boy, Donald,
&ldquo;your grandfather was trying to save
Mose&rsquo;s mule when he had that terrible fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Donald flashed him a friendly smile,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s sort of up to me to take on the burden
Grandfather has been forced to lay down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like that,&rdquo; Bex agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you know,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;Uncle Mose
has earned money mining coal beneath his little
patch of land and selling it to people down
in the settlement. It&rsquo;s a terrible sort of mine.
The coal doesn&rsquo;t lay flat down. It stands half
on edge. Mose has managed somehow. But
now&mdash;&rdquo; he sprang to his feet. &ldquo;Now Blinkey
Billy Blevens, the meanest old skunk out of
jail claims that his father bought the coal
rights on all the land up on Mose&rsquo;s creek, and
he says he can stop Mose from mining it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why he can&rsquo;t do that can he?&rdquo; Johnny
stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he can if he wants to. What we&rsquo;ll
have to do is to make him not want to. But
how? That&rsquo;s the question.&rdquo; Bex stared at the
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Appeal to his better nature,&rdquo; Johnny suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t any that anyone has ever discovered.
People have tried to find some good
side to him many times,&rdquo; Bex answered gloomily.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve never found it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some people can be frightened into doing
what is right. It&rsquo;s not very nice but sometimes
it&rsquo;s the only way. What&rsquo;s he likely to be afraid
of?&rdquo; Donald asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lightning,&rdquo; Bex replied promptly. &ldquo;Lightning
out of a clear sky. He claims he was once
knocked over and nearly killed by what he
calls a &lsquo;bolt from the blue.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; Johnny mused. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a large contract.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>Then the new boy, Donald Day, said something
very strange. What he said was, &ldquo;I
shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if we should be able to
arrange it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny stared.</p>
<p>But just then someone called to Bex from
outside the mill and Donald said once more
to Johnny:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to go down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once Johnny&rsquo;s mind was all awhirl with
thoughts of mysterious whispers and wheezes
from those lower regions of the mill, and with
the strange wealth that came from those
depths. &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he said once again. &ldquo;Sure I
would.&rdquo; So the other boy turned the key in the
lock and they went down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve helped my grandfather at this sort of
thing quite a lot,&rdquo; Donald said as he switched
on a light&mdash;the place below had no windows.
&ldquo;He used to have a shop just outside of the
city. That was where I worked with him most.
But the air there was too impure, too much
dust. Lot of smoke from chimneys and factories.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So he came down here.&rdquo; The boy seemed
to be talking to himself quite as much as to
Johnny. &ldquo;Air down here in the mountains is
about as pure as you can hope to find anywhere.
No cars shooting along kicking up dust
and coughing out gas. If any smoke passes
over, it crosses at the mountain tops, not down
here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another thing,&rdquo; he pushed a lever. There
came the sound of rushing water and slowly
revolving wheels. &ldquo;Another thing,&rdquo; he repeated,
&ldquo;this power down here is cheap. Don&rsquo;t cost
you anything. All you have to do is to keep
up the dam and see that the mill is in good repair.
You&rsquo;ve really got to have cheap power.
Costs only about half as much down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What costs half as much?&rdquo; Johnny thought
this question but did not ask it. Johnny could
wait.</p>
<p>From one corner came a sucking sound.
This increased until the room seemed full of
the sucking and hissing of a steam engine, yet
there was no steam. It was strange.</p>
<p>Donald dragged a canvas-covered something
from a corner. This proved to be a large jug.
It was not made of clay however, nor of glass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Porcelain,&rdquo; Donald explained as he saw
Johnny eyeing it. &ldquo;Better than metal because
it is a slow conductor of heat. Shrinkage in
this business is terrible. A gallon may last a
week&mdash;then it&rsquo;s gone. And you can&rsquo;t confine
it. Oh my, no! That is, I don&rsquo;t think you can,
at least not in any small way. There&rsquo;s a great
manufacturer somewhere up north, I&rsquo;ve heard
it said, who does confine it in large quantities.
But it&rsquo;s dangerous. Some secret process. No
one allowed near it. Blows the end out of a
building now and then. You can imagine what
this place would look like after an explosion,&rdquo;
he laughed. After that he slid the big jug in
a corner to connect it with a pipe. From the
pipe there came a sort of white smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White smoke,&rdquo; Johnny recalled Ballard&rsquo;s
words of some time back. &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s it all
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the moments that followed, his curiosity
grew and grew and grew. Then of a
sudden, the other boy said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dragging the big jug free, he tipped it over
to pour some white, steaming liquid over the
palm of his hand, then quickly shook it into
the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can do that&mdash;&rdquo; he slid the jug back
into its place. &ldquo;You can even take some in
your mouth. But you better spurt it out quick.
Just imagine, 216 degrees below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what is it?&rdquo; Johnny managed to
gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; The other boy stared. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
know? Why I&mdash;&rdquo; He stared afresh. Then he
pronounced two magic words: &ldquo;Liquid Air!&rdquo;
If Johnny did not think there was any magic
in them at that moment, he was soon enough
to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Air isn&rsquo;t a liquid,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
gas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water&rsquo;s not a liquid either,&rdquo; Donald smiled.
&ldquo;Not always. When you get it hot enough it
becomes steam, a gas. When you get it cold
enough it is ice, a solid. Air is just the same,
only difference is you have to get it terribly
cold before it becomes a liquid. That&rsquo;s just
what I&rsquo;m doing now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch those pumps. They&rsquo;re putting air
under great pressure. That makes it cold.
When it&rsquo;s just so cold, I run it over pipes full
of more air. That makes air number two
pretty cold. I put air number two under great
pressure. Then it is cold enough to turn into
a liquid, part of it. It drips off just as condensed
steam does.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And so-o,&rdquo; Johnny drawled, &ldquo;you get liquid
air. How much is it worth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From fifty cents to one dollar a quart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; Johnny whistled. &ldquo;High priced
air I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dropped into a chair. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s how
your grandfather got something valuable out
of nothing but the sky! Gold from the sky!&rdquo;
Johnny chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But say!&rdquo; he was on his feet again. &ldquo;Who
wants the stuff? What&rsquo;s it good for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Donald after turning a valve
and setting one more pump hissing, &ldquo;men go
about the country lecturing on liquid air, freezing
up tennis balls so hard they crack on the
floor like an egg shell, making tuning forks
out of lead by freezing it up, all that. They
buy liquid air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big mills that manufacture locomotives use
liquid air. They freeze up whole engine wheels
with liquid air, then put on the tires, which
are not frozen. When the wheel thaws out it
expands and there you have your tire on tight
as a drum. Funny business isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But mostly,&rdquo; he slid another jug into position,
&ldquo;liquid air is split up before it&rsquo;s used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Split up?&rdquo; Johnny stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Donald grinned. &ldquo;Air contains six
gases. The principal ones are oxygen and
nitrogen. Oxygen is used a great deal, nitrogen
very little, except in time of war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the other gases are used a great deal
too. Ever walk down the streets of a big city
at night and notice all the gleaming, flashing
signs?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember the inches of glass tubing all
full of something that glowed red, blue, green,
yellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, those tubes each contain gas, krypton,
argon, or neon. That&rsquo;s why they are
called neon signs. A great deal of that gas
comes from liquid air or is separated by the
aid of it. So you see, if we can supply manufacturers
with clean, cheap liquid air we
have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fortune!&rdquo; Johnny drew in a long breath.
&ldquo;How wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Donald said slowly, &ldquo;perhaps not a
fortune but a chance to live and to help others
a little, and that is something these days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liquid air,&rdquo; he went on after a moment,
&ldquo;makes a wonderful explosive. You see the
oxygen in liquid air is free to join with carbon.
All you have to do is to soak charcoal in liquid
air, attach a fuse to it, scratch a match then
run. The result is a glorious explosion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swell for Fourth of July!&rdquo; Johnny enthused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be though&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But say!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed. &ldquo;Why not
use it for mining coal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been done in Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Johnny stood up. His eyes gleamed.
&ldquo;Bex says that old Uncle Mose&rsquo;s mine contains
the toughest vein of coal he ever saw.
He picks away at it for hours and only gets a
small load. Suppose you could spare a little of
that liquid air?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some charcoal,&rdquo; Johnny was growing
enthusiastic. &ldquo;Whole lot of it. I got it
from a charcoal burner. Got some fuse too.&rdquo;
He was fairly dancing about. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make up
some of that carbon-liquid air explosive and
loosen up ten tons of coal for old Uncle Mose.
What a lift that will give him!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Donald agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always
wanted to try that thing out. We&rsquo;ll do it this
very afternoon. What do you say? Around
four o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me fine.&rdquo; Johnny grabbed his hat.
&ldquo;Got a thing or two that must be done. I&rsquo;ll be
back later for my next lecture on liquid air.
It sure is great!&rdquo; He was away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br />A STRANGE BEAR HUNT</h2>
<p>Four-thirty that afternoon found the
two boys trudging along the mountain
trail which Johnny, Bexter, and Ballard had
followed on that sad but eventful day when
the swinging bridge went down.</p>
<p>In Johnny&rsquo;s pocket was a bundle of tough
paper bags. Slung across his shoulder was a
sack of pulverized charcoal. In a sling, Donald
carried a jug of liquid air. &ldquo;Looks like a
water jug,&rdquo; Donald laughed. &ldquo;One drink from
that jug would be your last. Two hundred and
sixteen below zero!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw a bear on this trail a while back,&rdquo;
Johnny broke in. &ldquo;He had a young pig in his
mouth. Somebody&rsquo;s got to get that bear. Old
Uncle Mose lost another pig last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if we met him now?&rdquo; Donald stared
ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably miles away,&rdquo; Johnny replied
quietly.</p>
<p>A moment later they rounded a curve and,
off to the right, a dark opening appeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the cave,&rdquo; Johnny explained.
&ldquo;Grand place I guess. Bear went in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose he&rsquo;s in there now?&rdquo; Donald&rsquo;s tone
was eager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just go in a little way. Always did
want to see the inside of a cave. I&rsquo;ve got a
flashlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Can&rsquo;t stay long though. We&rsquo;ve
got to blow up a coal mine. Don&rsquo;t forget that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment more and they were winding in
and out over a narrow passageway. This passage
soon widened into a large room. Still another
moment and they were standing speechless
while Donald&rsquo;s flashlight played over
massive pillars of faultless white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s like a great, beautiful church,&rdquo;
Donald murmured low. In that still place even
his murmur echoed and re-echoed from pillar
to pillar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a place for silence,&rdquo; Johnny whispered.
Yet, even as he spoke that silence was
smashed into a million echoes by a tremendous
outburst of sound, a roar that might, Johnny
thought, have come from the throat of some
prehistoric monster. But Johnny was not deceived,
this was no mythical monster. It was
the bear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>What was to be done? The passage was
narrow, the bear apparently all but upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; With hands that trembled slightly,
Johnny filled a paper sack with charcoal, then
thrust a length of fuse into it.</p>
<p>Again there came that terrifying roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here. Give me that jug.&rdquo; Tipping the jug
on one side he saturated the charcoal in the
paper bag with liquid air. After that, drawing
on heavy mittens, he pressed the mixture into
a solid mass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Donald was trembling from head to foot but
Johnny was calm. He stared straight ahead
toward the spot where the bear at any second
might appear.</p>
<p>With the roar of the enraged bear still ringing
in his ears, Johnny calmly lighted the fuse
leading to the sack of liquid air and charcoal.</p>
<p>The fuse sputtered and flashed. It was a
fairly long fuse. Would it last thirty seconds?
Longer perhaps. Johnny felt the hair at the
back of his neck prickle and rise. It was a
tense moment. Before him was the bear, behind,
a narrow passage and at his feet that
strange explosive, liquid air and carbon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will it explode?&rdquo; he said aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will,&rdquo; Donald, his companion, replied.
Then, as if awaking to a new and terrible danger,
he fairly shouted in Johnny&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;Come
on! Run! Run for your life!&rdquo; Without a further
word, he turned and fled.</p>
<p>Johnny, who understood not at all, stood
still watching that fuse grow shorter and
shorter.</p>
<p>Then came the bear. With tongue lolling,
white teeth all agleam, he came roaring out of
the shadows. Johnny turned as if about to flee.
Then, remembering that a bear was fast, that
in that narrow passageway, he had no chance,
he turned resolutely about.</p>
<p>The bear, apparently catching a glimpse of
that sputtering spark of fire, reared himself on
his hind legs. With a sudden inspiration, Johnny
seized the bag of strange explosives and
hurled it at the bear. To his vast surprise, he
saw the bear catch it neatly between his steel-like
jaws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A chilly mouthful,&rdquo; was Johnny&rsquo;s mental
comment as he turned and fled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>Never in all his life had he travelled so fast
as now. Unconsciously, as he ran, he waited
for something. Just as he reached the last
straight stretch that led to daylight, the thing
happened. There came a dull explosion and
Johnny, as if seized by soft but powerful
hands, was lifted and pushed up and out of the
cave to land, sprawling, on a pile of gravel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! There you are!&rdquo; Donald exclaimed.
&ldquo;Ten seconds more and you would have been
too late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what happened?&rdquo; he asked in a puzzled
tone. &ldquo;You had enough explosive there to
fairly blow the roof off the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bear caught it.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s head was in
a whirl. &ldquo;He&mdash;he must have chewed it up and
wasted most of it. Do&mdash;do you suppose it got
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Donald chuckled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going
back to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither am I,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;So let&rsquo;s get
going. We&rsquo;ve got a coal mine to blow up before
dark.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>The mining experiment was a complete success.
Donald made up small parcels of liquid
air and carbon while Johnny drilled holes in
the coal. The charges were quickly stamped,
the fuses were lighted, and then they were
scampering up the rope ladder leading to the
mine and were away. There followed six loud
booms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That should do it,&rdquo; Johnny grinned.</p>
<p>As Johnny and Donald were walking back
to the mill, Donald stopped quite suddenly.
Looking away toward the top of the ridge
where a single power line cut across to a
distant coal mine, he said, &ldquo;We might do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; Johnny asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring a bolt out of the blue. At least we
might make it seem that way for the benefit
of that man, Blinkey Bill Blevens you know,
who&rsquo;s been going to make it hard for old Uncle
Mose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might?&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Anyway, I&rsquo;ll give it a good think,&rdquo;
was Donald&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>Truth was, Johnny had only half heard him.
He had suddenly remembered something. Jack
Dawson, the aviator, who had come to live
down there on the edge of the meadow, had
said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;d have made the trip faster if we&rsquo;d
had my new motor going.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A new kind of fuel,&rdquo; Johnny whispered to
himself. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he said. More foot
pounds of energy than any other fuel. Wonder
what it could be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a rather late hour that same afternoon,
Jensie and Ballard sat on the trunk of a fallen
tree. They were both deliciously weary. All
day they had tramped the hillsides. The dry
leaves had rustled beneath their feet. From
time to time beechnuts had come showering
down upon them. At other times too, the deep
baying of Ballard&rsquo;s big red hound had told
them of squirrels up a tree. It had been grand.</p>
<p>Now they could see the sun casting long
mountain shadows over the valley far below.
At their side rested six red squirrels and one
big fat striped coon. Yes, it had been glorious.
Garbed in her knickers and russet red sweater,
the girl seemed a part of it all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Ballard exclaimed quite suddenly.
&ldquo;Bees!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jensie listened but heard nothing. The
sharp-eared boy was not long in pointing out
a huge, hollow chestnut tree. Some thirty feet
from the ground Jensie caught sight of a faint,
wavering line.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bee tree!&rdquo; Ballard was excited. &ldquo;A
big swarm. Hundred pounds of honey, mebby
two hundred. Monday I&rsquo;ll come up and cut it
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monday, Ballard?&rdquo; There was a power of
suggestion in the girl&rsquo;s tone.</p>
<p>Ballard made no reply. His face, as he looked
away at the hills was a study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ballard,&rdquo; the girl&rsquo;s voice was low and
husky, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve been to school together all our
lives. We belong to the mountains, you and I.
And because we belong, we have to do all we
can for the mountains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday, I saw the coach.&rdquo; Ballard shifted
uneasily. &ldquo;I asked if he&rsquo;d take you back on
the team. He said, &lsquo;Ballard&rsquo;s never been off
the team.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl paused. Ballard&rsquo;s hand clutched at
the log. His lips moved. He did not speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The coach said,&rdquo; Jensie went on after a
time, &ldquo;that he understood the code of the
mountains. He&rsquo;s lived down here. But he says
the code of the mountains is not the code of
Hillcrest. He said that people who call other
folks vile names don&rsquo;t have to be killed for it.
In time they kill themselves. They get to talking
out real loud and then they lose all their
friends. After that they may not be dead but
they might as well be.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Once again the girl paused. The shadows
in the valley had grown longer. All the
meadow lands were in the shadows now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ballard,&rdquo; she began again, &ldquo;we mountain
folks can&rsquo;t be quitters. I quit once. Daddy
sent me away to school. I couldn&rsquo;t take it. I
came home. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve always been sorry for that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you, Ballard,&rdquo; she touched his hand,
&ldquo;you are a boy. Boys are strong, you can&rsquo;t
quit. It&rsquo;s for the mountains, Ballard, and for
your future, all the glorious, golden days that
lie ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I think we better go down now.&rdquo; She
took up her gun. The big red hound sprang
to his feet. They were off.</p>
<p>Their way home led past Cousin Bill&rsquo;s store.
Johnny sat on the bench beside the door. He
was whittling and talking to old Noah Pennington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Johnny,&rdquo; Jensie greeted. &ldquo;When are
we going back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any time you say. How about nine tomorrow
morning?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tha&mdash;that will be fine, Johnny. Won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
The girl turned to Ballard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; Ballard stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come to my house or shall we
pick you up at the rim where we dropped you
last night?&rdquo; Jensie asked cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be at the rim, Jensie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. We&rsquo;ll be going on down. Come
and see me, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you at nine,&rdquo; Johnny grinned happily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it to the women,&rdquo; Johnny murmured
when they were out of ear-shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; old Noah Pennington, who sat at
his side, agreed. &ldquo;Leave it to the women. Be
a lot sorrier times in this here world if it
weren&rsquo;t fer the women folks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br />WILD MEN, BABOONS, AND SOMETHING STRANGE</h2>
<p>The shadows of night had fallen when the
three wanderers, Jensie, Johnny, and Ballard
in their car came to a gliding stop before
the Blue Moon.</p>
<p>The door stood half open. A mellow glow
of light shone at their feet as they hopped out.
From within came the murmur of voices and
low laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old Blue Moon is still doing fine,&rdquo;
Johnny smiled happily. &ldquo;Come on in and have
a snack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner had the door framed their faces
than a voice shouted: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Old Kentucky!
Kentucky and that mountain gal. Come on,
Old Kentucky, give us a tune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once the crowd, composed of all the team
and many of their friends, was on its feet and
cheering huskily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>Seizing his companions, Johnny pushed
them to the front. Picking up Jensie as if she
were a sack of sugar, he set her down on the
counter, then thrust a banjo in her hands as he
whispered, &ldquo;Do your durndest. Nothing could
be better than this.&rdquo; She flashed him an understanding
smile. Then, after motioning Ballard
to a place by her side, she began thrumming
the chords, and &ldquo;Old Kentucky Home&rdquo; came
whispering through the room.</p>
<p>Greeted by abundant applause, the two
young Kentuckians played and sang their way
through a half score of melodious mountain
tunes into the very hearts of their listeners.</p>
<p>Then, of a sudden, Jensie struck her banjo a
thwack. She ran her fingers across the strings
to begin &ldquo;Roll, Jordan, Roll! Roll, Jordan,
Roll! Oh! Oh! Oh! I want to go there, to hear
old Jordan roll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly every boy and girl in the room was
on his feet and singing. How the rafters of
the old Blue Moon rang.</p>
<p>Song followed song. Quaint, beautiful, melodious
negro minstrels that fitted the closing
of the Sabbath day, they filled the minds of
happy, carefree youth with a mellow joy that
is experienced oh, so seldom, in a long, long
life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a wonderful bunch,&rdquo; Johnny said
huskily as he helped Jensie into the car an hour
later. &ldquo;A wonderful, wonderful bunch of fellows.
Next Saturday they will go out on the
field and romp all over it to the tune of a dozen
touchdowns. And already, thank God, they&rsquo;ve
forgotten Kentucky&rsquo;s blunder that cost them a
game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Kentucky will be the hero of the hour
next Saturday, you&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; Jensie exulted.
&ldquo;Kentucky! My Kentucky forever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night Johnny sat long musing beside
the fire. Surely there were matters enough to
occupy his thoughts. Kentucky was back.
These mountain people had a way of winning
their way into people&rsquo;s hearts. He was glad
of that. But what of the games that were to
come? Could this mountain boy control his
hot temper when things went wrong? He wondered
and shuddered a little.</p>
<p>He thought of the bear and laughed. The
bear was dead all right. He had told Lige
Fields about that explosion in the cave. Lige
was short of fresh meat. To a Kentucky mountain
man, nothing is better than a good juicy
bear steak. He had found the bear with his
head blown clean off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Powerful stuff, liquid air and carbon,&rdquo; the
boy said to himself. He had some of the bear
steak in his car. They&rsquo;d have it for dinner in
the back room of the Blue Moon tomorrow.
He&rsquo;d invite Coach Dizney and a few of the
boys.</p>
<p>He thought of Old Mose and his mule,
thought too of the &ldquo;ornery no-count&rdquo; Blinkey
Bill who planned to beat Mose out of his coal
mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said we might fix up a little bolt of
lightning out of the blue,&rdquo; Johnny murmured.
He was thinking now of Donald Day. Queer
sort of fellow, Donald was, mighty fine too. He
wondered how a fellow&rsquo;d go about manufacturing
a &ldquo;bolt from the blue.&rdquo; He&rsquo;d like to be
around when it happened, would too if it were
possible. He could steal away down there in
the middle of the week. Artie Stark would
manage the Blue Moon in his absence. Plenty
of boys needed work.</p>
<p>Another thing he meant to look into. He
wanted to visit that young aviator down there
in the Kentucky valley. What kind of a motor
could he be building? Johnny was interested
in all sorts of mechanical contraptions. He had
once owned a car that ran on dust, just ordinary
coal dust.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be that,&rdquo; he whispered to himself.
&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny was growing drowsy. But now, of a
sudden, he was wide awake. The latch clicked.
There came the sound of shuffling feet. Johnny
caught sight of a shadowy figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pant,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Panther Eye, is that
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Johnny,&rdquo; the strange fellow&rsquo;s voice
was low. &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s me. But don&rsquo;t talk so loud
Johnny, not quite so loud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As on those other occasions, Johnny prepared
a small feast for his wandering friend.
Tonight, instead of talking, he sat silently
watching until the last bite was gone. Then
he said quite suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he find you?&rdquo; Johnny eyed Pant
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who find me?&rdquo; Pant stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you forgotten?&rdquo; Johnny asked in surprise.
&ldquo;The shadow. That giant with a hooked
nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see it?&rdquo; It was Pant&rsquo;s turn to be
surprised.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say I saw it. Gives me the creeps just
thinking about it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o,&rdquo; Pant said slowly, &ldquo;he hasn&rsquo;t found
me, not&mdash;not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant dropped into a chair. At once his face
became a mask. Only the gleam of his curious
pink eyes, told that he was alive. Johnny knew
the meaning of this, Pant, like a turtle, had
withdrawn into his shell. Johnny settled into
his place to take up a pencil and begin tracing
geometric figures on a square of paper.</p>
<p>Pant was first to break the long silence that
followed. When he did speak it was as if the
many hours that had passed since their last
meeting had not been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be surprised, Johnny,&rdquo; he said as an
amused smile played about the corners of his
mouth. &ldquo;Perhaps you won&rsquo;t believe what I
tell you&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve got to finish that thing I
was telling you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; Johnny urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we went into that cave, that mysterious
girl that may have been white. I don&rsquo;t
know about that&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We hadn&rsquo;t been in there ten minutes when
we heard a shuffling sound by the cave&rsquo;s entrance
and what do you think?&rdquo; Pant paused
to stare at a spot on the wall. &ldquo;What could
you expect? Almost anything. What was it
but that troop of giant baboons!&rdquo; Once again
Pant paused.</p>
<p>Involuntarily Johnny allowed his eyes to
stray to the window shade. No shadow there
tonight. Even the tree branches were still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; Pant gave vent to a low chuckle,
&ldquo;there we were, that girl and I crowded way
back in the cave. And there were the baboons.
They came shuffling in, like thirty or forty
boys playing hooky from school. And silent!
Say! I didn&rsquo;t suppose any wild creature except
maybe a tiger could be that quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl was scared. Plumb scared to
death. As she crowded close to me, I could
feel her heart beat madly like it might burst.
Surprised me that did, because these natives
all know a baboon won&rsquo;t hurt you. Made me
think she was all white. Suppose she was,
Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know? Didn&rsquo;t you find out?&rdquo;
Johnny asked in surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I&mdash;but where was I?&rdquo; Pant broke off.
&ldquo;Oh, yes! That wasn&rsquo;t all, not half, Johnny.
You won&rsquo;t believe it but I&rsquo;m going to tell you
just the same. The baboons hadn&rsquo;t much more
than got good and settled, when there came
another quick shuffle outside the cave and in
popped&mdash;who do you think?&rdquo; Pant drew in a
quick breath. &ldquo;That whole band of wild men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have been a large cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was!&rdquo; Pant exclaimed. &ldquo;But not big
enough for all that outfit, anyway not if that
something strange that was after them decided
to come in too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Pant went on after a pause, &ldquo;the
strange thing didn&rsquo;t come. Perhaps there
wasn&rsquo;t anything strange. Maybe these wild
fellows just imagined it. But there were
baboons and wild men and that girl and I&mdash;which
was a whole lot too many. The baboons
kept crowding back, back, back, until one big
fellow was square against my side and that
girl between me and the rocky wall of the
cave. And all the time that bunch of huge
baboons, scared stiff by the wild men, who
are always hunting them, crowding more and
more until I was sure we&rsquo;d be crushed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Something had to be done, Johnny, and I
did it. I had a short hunting knife in my belt.
Getting a good grip on it I lifted it high to
bring it down square between that nearest
baboon&rsquo;s shoulder blades. And then&mdash;&rdquo; Pant
broke off to indulge in a prolonged reminiscent
chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Johnny urged, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll see that
shadow again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&mdash;well&mdash;to tell the truth, Johnny,
there&rsquo;s little left to tell. That baboon let out
a most terrific roar. After that there was
noise, dust and confusion. That lasted three
full minutes I guess, and after that, believe it
or not, they were gone, baboons, wild men,
and all. That cave was as silent as a tomb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sorry about that baboon,&rdquo; Pant went
on after a moment. &ldquo;I never like to hurt any
living creature. But what else could I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;nothing,&rdquo; Johnny shook himself. Had
he been listening to a fairy story or a real adventure?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We waited an hour, that girl and I,&rdquo; Pant
continued in a matter-of-fact tone. &ldquo;After that
we crept out into the bright sunlight. We
looked about. There was no one to be seen,
not even a baboon. You better believe me we
got out of there quick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; Pant stretched his long legs, &ldquo;I
found that river again. Then I knew where I
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the girl?&rdquo; Johnny breathed softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had no idea where we were. And I feel
quite sure&mdash;&rdquo; Pant paused to consider, &ldquo;yes,
I&rsquo;m certain she had no idea what I was up to.
She followed me as she might have followed
that big man with a hooked nose, had he given
her the chance, followed because there was
nothing else to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I kept getting more and more signs. A
fallen tree, a particular cluster of hanging
vines I&rsquo;d noticed before, a tumble-down native
hut, all these told me I was on the right track.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a little before sunset, I came to a spot
I was sure of. It was not a hundred yards from
that clearing, the picture clearing, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the pasture, the cattle, the gem of a
cottage,&rdquo; Johnny supplemented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the girl lost out of it,&rdquo; Pant broke in.
&ldquo;I was going to put her back into the picture.
I DID put her back,&rdquo; there was a note of triumph
in Pant&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;I stopped dead in my
tracks, pushed the girl on before me, then
pointed straight ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;At first she did not seem to understand,
just stood there staring. In the end, I&rsquo;m sure
she only half understood, for she seemed to go
reluctantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I watched her until she was ready to part
the branches that were to give her a glimpse
of home, then I ducked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can hide, Johnny, hide anywhere, always
could. It&rsquo;s a gift. I wasn&rsquo;t a minute too soon,
for I was scarcely under cover when she let
out a scream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A scream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! One wild scream of pure joy. She
had seen her home. Probably up to that moment,
she had never hoped to see it again. Who
wouldn&rsquo;t scream?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; Pant indulged in a broad grin,
&ldquo;what do you suppose she did after that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Went down through the jungle like a
scared rabbit,&rdquo; suggested Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. You&rsquo;re wrong,&rdquo; Pant heaved a sigh.
&ldquo;She stood there for a moment. Then she
turned and started back. Looking for me&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t
you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure would.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But she didn&rsquo;t find me,&rdquo; Pant added dryly.
&ldquo;You bet she didn&rsquo;t. I can hide, you know
that, Johnny. That&rsquo;s one time I did a good
job of hiding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Johnny stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know, Johnny,&rdquo; Pant replied
slowly, &ldquo;you can never tell what a lady will do
when she discovers quite suddenly that you&rsquo;ve
done her a very good turn. You can&rsquo;t now, can
you, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Johnny laughed. &ldquo;You
really can not. I&rsquo;ve known them to throw
their arms about their benefactor and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kiss him,&rdquo; Pant made a face. &ldquo;And that,
Johnny, would have been horrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Johnny said slowly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
purely a matter of taste. Anyway, you were
not quite fair to her. You had saved her from
slavery, worse than death. You didn&rsquo;t even
give her a chance to thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of that, Johnny. Went back to
the edge of the clearing the very next day.
Had some notion of showing myself. But I
didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; Pant broke off abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The picture was there, Johnny, pasture,
cattle, house and even the girl. There was one
slight change. A man sat before the cabin, a
tall, thin man in a white suit. Across his knees
lay a long-barreled rifle. How that barrel did
gleam in the sun! So-o, Johnny, I didn&rsquo;t go
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t looking for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not. But people do sometimes
make mistakes. And really, it didn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was one time when Pant was mistaken,
more mistaken than he could imagine. It did
matter. It mattered a great deal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be going, Johnny,&rdquo; Pant stood
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the hurry, Pant? No shadows tonight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There might be, Johnny, you never can
tell. Good-night, Johnny.&rdquo; He was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shadow of a glorious past,&rdquo; Johnny
murmured low.</p>

<br />VICTORY</h2>
<p>The look of grim determination on Ballard&rsquo;s
face as he took up practice next day
was both inspiring and disturbing to his good
friend, Red Dynamite, who, by this time had
come to love the Kentucky boy as he might a
younger brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady, son,&rdquo; he warned as Ballard overran
three long forward passes in a row. &ldquo;Head
work counts more than footwork.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ballard quieted down. For a good hour and
a half after that, the work of run-and-pass,
pass-pass-and-run, then pass again went on
without a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Dynamite exclaimed at last, &ldquo;That
should do for one day. Come on over to the
Blue Moon for a hot chocolate malted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kentucky dropped in beside him. Together
they tramped from the practice field.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; Dynamite said soberly, &ldquo;when
you&rsquo;ve been around a place like this long as I
have you get to love it. Every foot of ground,
every stick and brick, every man and woman
comes to mean something to you. They give
you a chance here. Suppose I could go to one
of those big schools? Not a chance! But here,
here I sit and listen to the hiss of steam in the
old boiler room. Every fifteen minutes I hop
up to feed in some coal and prod the fires. Every
day I eat dust and breathe a little smoke
while I drag the ashes out. That&rsquo;s all I have
to do and that gets me a college education.
By and by, a degree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all the time,&rdquo; he drew in a long, deep
breath, &ldquo;all the time I&rsquo;m living. Living grand,
Kentucky, better than I may ever live again.
You&rsquo;ll come to love it too, Kentucky. You&rsquo;ll
want to fight and fight and fight for old Hillcrest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the Blue Moon,&rdquo; he exclaimed as if
afraid he had been guilty of preaching. &ldquo;Fill
&rsquo;em up, Artie!&rdquo; he held two hands wide apart.
&ldquo;Two big long ones. Double malt and triple
chocolate, steaming hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two long ones coming up,&rdquo; Artie grinned
broadly. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s Kentucky coming on?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; Dynamite banged the table with his
huge fist, then made the sound of wind whistling
through his teeth. &ldquo;Just watch us next
Saturday! I smack &rsquo;em down and Kentucky
goes through for a touchdown. Score&rsquo;ll be
about thirty-one to nothing I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But would it? As Dynamite watched the
Kentucky boy practice, each day he seemed to
see him growing slimmer, more hollow-eyed
and nervous. Nor was he the only one who
watched. Kenneth Roberts the English professor
was a real fellow. He knew boys as well
as English. He had written three books for
boys, real thrillers that clicked. When on
Thursday, Kentucky sitting on the front seat
slept all the way through his class, English
B-3, he asked the boy to remain after class.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ballard,&rdquo; he said without a smile, &ldquo;you
slept through my class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Ballard blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A class room,&rdquo; the teacher&rsquo;s voice took on
a mellow, kindly note, &ldquo;is a poor place to sleep.
You&rsquo;ve been practicing too hard and too long.
You&rsquo;ll defeat yourself. I want you to do three
things, stop practicing, sleep twelve hours tonight,
cut all your classes tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll fix
it up about the classes. We&mdash;we&rsquo;re watching
you, boy. We&rsquo;re pulling for you, son, and&mdash;and
praying for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Than&mdash;&rdquo; the boy&rsquo;s chin quivered, &ldquo;thanks
awfully. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll do whatever you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is said there is power in prayer. If this
is true the good professor&rsquo;s prayers were not
in vain. Hillcrest had never witnessed such
a game of football as was played on their grid-iron
the next sunny Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>As they watched, it seemed that their own
team consisted of but two men. One had been
dubbed Old Kentucky, the other Red Dynamite.
This, of course, was not true. There
were eleven men on the team. On the defensive,
blocking and tackling, they were all
one. Even on the offensive, in his own quiet
way, each man did his full share.</p>
<p>Even so, as the fans watched, they saw again
and again a strapping fellow in red jersey
break through the opponent&rsquo;s line to go flaming
down the field. At once the cry arose:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dy-na-mite! Dy-na-mite! Red! Red! Red!
Dy-na-mite!&rdquo; The rooters came in time to
turn that cry into a series of explosions, like
the clash and clatter of a front-line battle.</p>
<p>But always, with a pigskin tucked in the
hollow of his arm, there followed a slender
torch of red. And this was Old Kentucky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>As they advanced down the field, Dynamite,
with uncanny wisdom, picked the onrushing
opponents one by one. Those who remained,
sprang all in vain at the wisp of red that, like
a flaming cardinal, went fluttering past them
to a touchdown.</p>
<p>Twice this unusual pair achieved a run of
sixty yards to a touchdown. When the game
was over, the score stood one point below
Dave&rsquo;s prophecy: 30-0.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure done uncommon good today!&rdquo;
Johnny exclaimed dropping into a slow Kentucky
drawl as Ballard entered the Blue Moon.</p>
<p>It was closing time. The lights were low.
The fire in the big stove gave forth an inviting
mellow glow. The mountain boy dropped
silently into a chair, stretched his feet straight
out before him, then, eyes half closed, sat there
silent while the clock ticked off a full quarter
hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he roused at last, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what old
Noah Pennington would call a &lsquo;right smart of
a ball game.&rsquo; But, do you know, Johnny, I
don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever do my part as well again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Johnny agreed, understanding
on the instant. &ldquo;There are times
in all our lives when some special thing gives
us a mighty push and we climb to heights we
may never hope to reach again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Ballard, old boy,&rdquo; he hastened to add,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll do well enough. Now you&rsquo;ve got going,
nothing can stop you. For once Hillcrest has
a winning team and I&rsquo;m glad, mighty glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow I&rsquo;m coming back to work here
in the Blue Moon,&rdquo; Ballard said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Artie Stark has done enough for me. Every
fellow&rsquo;s got to make his own way,&rdquo; he continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Ballard,&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s tone was as
quiet as the other boy&rsquo;s, but he felt a surge of
warmth work its way through his being. He
loved every boy who took his place in life&rsquo;s
battle-line prepared to do his part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be a lot of help, Ballard,&rdquo; there was
real enthusiasm in his voice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be popular.
That will help the Blue Moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m glad you think so, Johnny,&rdquo; there
was a wealth of gratitude in the mountain
boy&rsquo;s tone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br />ONE MINUTE TO PLAY</h2>
<p>On the following Monday evening a meeting
of the team was called by Coach
Dizney. When they gathered in the back room
of the Blue Moon, the players found a blackboard
hung upon the wall. Lines, circles, and
arrows had been drawn upon the board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next Saturday, as you all know,&rdquo; the coach
began, &ldquo;we are to play Pitt Tech. And I&rsquo;m giving
you fair warning that we are up against a
stiff proposition. Like the other teams we&rsquo;ve
played, they&rsquo;re heavier than you are, ten or
twelve pounds to the man. Worse than that
they are fiends at breaking up forward passes.
I&rsquo;ve looked up their record for this year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he paused, &ldquo;so what shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;New plays,&rdquo; suggested Stagger Weed, the
center.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; the coach smiled. &ldquo;Newer, bigger,
and better plays and trickier ones. Now
here,&rdquo; he turned to the board, &ldquo;here is a play
that&rsquo;s a humdinger if you boys have the brains
and the nerve to carry it through.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah brains,&rdquo; Punch Dickman laughed,
&ldquo;we check them in the class room before we
pass out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better bring them along next Saturday,&rdquo;
the coach snapped back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now this,&rdquo; he began once more, &ldquo;as you
will see, as far as the line goes, is a balanced
formation. The right half is behind his own
tackle, full-back behind right guard two yards
from line of scrimmage and left half three
yards back behind center. Quarter is in regular
position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he drew in a long breath, &ldquo;the ball
goes back to quarter. Right end and right
tackle plunge ahead prepared to block any interference.
The right half and center drop in
to fill these places, to prevent a break through
the line. The left half-back goes out about
five steps directly to the right, then turns and
starts back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you following me?&rdquo; He did not wait
for a reply. &ldquo;When the quarter gets the ball
he immediately faces left and the left end
comes round like an end-around play. The
quarter fakes giving him the ball but hugs it
tightly to his noble breast. When the Pitt line
has swung round after our left end, the quarter
leaps to position and laterals the ball to
Old Kentucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Old Kentucky goes racing forward to
a touchdown,&rdquo; Rabbit Jones the right half
breathed. &ldquo;How sweet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a keen play,&rdquo; Red Dynamite exclaimed.
&ldquo;If we only know it well enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to know it well enough!&rdquo; the
coach struck the table with his fist. &ldquo;That one
and two or three more as hard to learn and as
swell to play, if only you know how. Will you
do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea&mdash;yea&mdash;yea&mdash;&rdquo; they exclaimed in unison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just got to do it!&rdquo; Stagger said with
solemn emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now the next play,&rdquo; the coach wiped
the board clean, drew more circles then started
explaining a second trick performance.</p>
<p>All that week, sweating and toiling, working
the old beans overtime, the team went through
the business of acting out plays that in the
beginning were confusing but in the end as
natural and clear as the bright light of day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>More than once, during those gruelling
hours as Johnny stood beside him watching,
the coach turned to him with a smile to exclaim
low:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy, Johnny! You sure found us a
player. I never saw anything like the way
that Kentucky boy takes in those new plays.
Quick as a whip too! I suppose it&rsquo;s his Kentucky
breeding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure is,&rdquo; Johnny grinned. &ldquo;There are times
down there in the mountains when there are
just two classes of people. The quick and the
dead. The quick one gets his gun out from
under his coat, the other just naturally goes to
the cemetery. Kentucky&rsquo;s grandfather was
killed in a feud. His father had a silk handkerchief
drawn through his chest once, where
a bullet had gone first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; the coach whistled, &ldquo;No wonder
he&rsquo;s quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strangely enough, despite the coach&rsquo;s warning,
apparently disregarding all their trick
plays, Dynamite, who was captain and called
the plays, started the game with a series of
forward passes. The first two were blocked.
The third, almost a lateral pass, was good for
a gain of five yards.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>They punted, held the opposing team to a
single first down, then, as the opposing team
punted, began again with forward passes. The
second of these was intercepted and, but for a
lightning-like tackle by Old Kentucky&mdash;which
brought the spectators to their feet&mdash;might
have resulted in disaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good?&rdquo; Stagger grumbled.
&ldquo;Lose our shirt, first thing we know.&rdquo; Dynamite
made no reply.</p>
<p>Once again as they came into possession of
the ball, the opposing team failed to gain.
They tried for a field goal at forty yards. No
good.</p>
<p>Hillcrest&rsquo;s ball on their own twenty-yard
line. Once more a pass. This time, by great
good fortune, it was received by Dynamite
who blasted his way down to the enemy&rsquo;s
forty-five-yard line.</p>
<p>After that more passes. Scarcely was the
Hillcrest team in a huddle when a certain half-back
began shouting: &ldquo;Pass! Pass!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then something strange and startling happened.
The team lined up and, as the ball was
snapped, Kentucky, Artie Stark and Tony
Blazes raced to receiving positions. The enemy,
eager to block or intercept a pass swarmed
after them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>But the ball was not passed. Just as Punch,
the full-back, posed the ball for the throw,
like a blackbird after a cherry, Dynamite
seized it from behind, went sweeping away
around left end which was all but deserted,
bumped squarely into one lonesome Pitt player,
sent him sprawling and romped away to
a touchdown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see that?&rdquo; a letter-man of other
days exclaimed. &ldquo;The old Statue of Liberty
play. And gloriously executed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glorious!&rdquo; echoed his companions. &ldquo;Say!
These boys are making football history! And
I&rsquo;m told that more than half of them are working
their way. Quite wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful and terrible,&rdquo; was the other&rsquo;s
reply. &ldquo;We old grads ought at least to furnish
a training table, where they could eat without
cost during the season anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The score, after the kick, stood 7-0. The
boys were jubilant. They were playing a supposedly
superior team and beating them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>That was the end to forward passes. All the
passes that had gone before were in preparation
for this one grand stroke. Now it should
be something else.</p>
<p>The next play they tried was too difficult.
Artie Stark was smeared for a loss of three
yards. Worse still the ball bounced from his
grasp and was pounced upon by the enemy.</p>
<p>After that, despite the team&rsquo;s heroic efforts
to block them, their heavy weight enemies battered
their way to a touchdown. The kick was
good. The first half ended a tie.</p>
<p>The Hillcrest team received the ball at the
start of the second half. Punch Dickman carried
it back to his own forty-yard line. When
the team went into a huddle, Dynamite hissed
two words that made them gasp: &ldquo;Modified
suicide!&rdquo; This was all he said. It was enough.
Every boy&rsquo;s nerves tingled as they lined up for
the play. It was a strange formation, five men
to right of center, one, the end, at the left.
Kentucky was in his usual position only two
yards back. Rabbit Jones, the other half-back,
was thirty yards out from the end of the line.
Center and full-back crouched behind the line.
Signals were to be called on this play.</p>
<p>Artie Stark was calling, &ldquo;Six&mdash;ten&mdash;seven&mdash;ten&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>Dynamite was listening. Stagger Weed,
big, a little too fat and very obviously the center,
moved uneasily, but no one noticed this.
As the last &ldquo;ten&rdquo; was called, Dynamite stepped
in behind Stagger&rsquo;s great bulk. Rabbit Jones
moved forward to the line of scrimmage.
Someone from the bleachers roared, &ldquo;Forward
pass!&rdquo; He was right, more right than he knew.</p>
<p>The eyes of the opposing back field were on
Rabbit Jones. &ldquo;Six&mdash;seven&mdash;nine&mdash;eleven&rdquo;
Artie droned the numbers. The ball was
snapped. It went to Punch, the full-back. He
leaped to the right, took three backward steps,
then threw the ball high and far, not to the
right, but to the left. Not to Rabbit Jones, but
to Stagger, the center. Stagger gathered the
ball to his ample bosom then went lumbering
like a freight train toward the distant goal.
And why not? There was no one to stop him.</p>
<p>Then such a roar as went up from the Pitt
side of the bleachers. How the Pitt team
crowded around the referee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s their center!&rdquo; they protested. &ldquo;Their
center! The center is not eligible to receive the
ball.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all wet,&rdquo; was the good natured
referee&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;When the ball was snapped,
there was no player at the left of center. That
made him left end. And so-o&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not finish. There was no need. The
disconsolate Pitt players, wandered back to
the line.</p>
<p>The kick was good. &ldquo;Fourteen to seven,&rdquo;
Dynamite exulted. &ldquo;If only we can hold it.
And we must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did not hold it, at least not for long.
There is something about being totally deceived,
that makes men see red. The Pitt men
had been thoroughly tricked. They saw red,
very red indeed. In the next five minutes they
took the ball from Hillcrest, made three first
downs, threw a long forward pass, then went
over the line. The kick, however, went wild.
They were still beaten unless&mdash;</p>
<p>The whistle blew for the end of the third
quarter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to hold &rsquo;em!&rdquo; Dynamite muttered
to Kentucky as they lay on the grass.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just got to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best way to do that is to better our lead,&rdquo;
was Kentucky&rsquo;s courageous reply. &ldquo;Remember
how we went through left tackle?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dynamite did try it again and with results
he could not foresee.</p>
<p>The very first time Kentucky took the ball
and Dynamite blasted him a trail, they went
clean through the defense line of the enemy
and were away. Then the fighting flight was
on. Dynamite hit a husky opponent and sent
him spinning. A second man appeared on the
horizon. Dynamite took him on. He was big
and powerful. Perhaps he fouled by holding,
Dynamite did not quite know. At any rate
they went down in a heap and Kentucky, the
slim, fast-footed half-back sped on.</p>
<p>A vast shadow loomed before him&mdash;the opposing
team&rsquo;s safety man. Grinning, Kentucky
sprang forward to offer him the ball.</p>
<p>Perhaps the giant had heard of this trick.
Perhaps he was too dumb to want the ball.
Whatever it may have been, he did not reach
for the ball. Instead, he lammed straight at
the slim youth. Kentucky was not quick
enough. With an impact that could be heard
all over the field, they went down in a heap.
And Kentucky did not get up. Even when the
referee took the ball from his hands, he did
not stir. He was out for keeps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Kentucky!&rdquo; It was Jensie who spoke
these words. She had seen it all and had come
racing onto the field. It was she who directed
the boys that picked him up, ever so gently,
and carried him from the field.</p>
<p>Meantime the game went on. Football is the
game of war. When a few wounded have been
carried from the field, a battle does not stop.</p>
<p>It was a grim battle that followed. No one
blamed that big full-back, not really, and yet&mdash;They
must not win now. Pitt must not!</p>
<p>The crippled Hillcrest team battled hard but
could not gain. They punted. Pitt carried the
ball far into their territory. Two brilliantly
executed passes by Pitt men brought the ball
to the Hillcrest ten-yard line. One line buck
and the distance to a touchdown was cut to
five yards, one more line buck and a slim yard
stood between Pitt and victory.</p>
<p>The Hillcrest bleachers were screaming:
&ldquo;Hold that line! Hold that line! Hold that
line!&rdquo; From the wall of blue on the opposite
side came the words of a song: &ldquo;Forward!
Forward! March against the foe!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>Little more than one moment to play with
the ball on Hillcrest&rsquo;s one-yard line. It was a
tense situation. Pitt went into a huddle,
snapped out of it quickly, crouched like tigers,
shuffled uneasily for ten seconds, then&mdash;the
ball sped. Dynamite followed it with his eye.
&ldquo;There! There! There it is!&rdquo; His muscles
registered a sensation that may never have
reached his brain.</p>
<p>The Pitt full-back had the ball&mdash;that same
giant whose hurdling force had crushed poor,
slender Kentucky. Dynamite bore him no
grudge&mdash;it was all in the game. And yet&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
all for Old Kentucky!&rdquo; he hissed as, straight
as an arrow, he shot at the full-back. He struck
him with the sudden, solid impact of a bullet.
The ball leaped from the opponent&rsquo;s hands.
By some strange chance, it shot straight into
the air. It came curving down into Artie
Stark&rsquo;s arms. Too astonished to believe in his
luck, Artie started streaking down the field.
Only one opponent half-heartedly followed.
The moment was all for Artie. So too was the
game for, a half minute after the play, the
whistle blew and Hillcrest&rsquo;s most exciting,
most astonishing game was at an end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br />GLIDING TOWARD FRESH ADVENTURE</h2>
<p>Artie Stark was carried off the field in
triumph. This was natural enough.
Dynamite did not in the least begrudge him
the honor, for had it not been his spectacular
run in the last minute of the game that saved
the day? How many had seen Dynamite&rsquo;s wild
plunge through the line, the plunge that broke
up the opponent&rsquo;s play? Very few. Such
things are not seen. It is the lad with the long
run to his credit who receives the cheers.
Dynamite did not care. He did not so much as
think of it. His mind was occupied with other
matters. He and Johnny Thompson walked
off the field together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Kentucky,&rdquo; Dynamite was saying.
&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t seem to have any luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; Johnny replied quietly, &ldquo;it
was he who won today&rsquo;s game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; his generous hearted companion
agreed. &ldquo;To think of practically putting
the game on ice, then being smashed up!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope,&rdquo; he added soberly, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s
not too bad. We sure don&rsquo;t get the breaks.
Just when we&rsquo;re all keyed up and ready to go
after anything, then to lose our best man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is tough,&rdquo; Johnny agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And next Saturday,&rdquo; Dynamite groaned
afresh, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re up against St. Regis, the lightest,
fastest team in the Little Seven. Think
what it will be with Kentucky out of the game.
But then,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;it may not be so bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get over to the infirmary and see
him won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Johnny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you later,&rdquo; Johnny turned to the
right. &ldquo;Have to get over to the Blue Moon.
The place will be a wild scramble.&rdquo; It was,
all of that and more. Plenty of work for everyone.
The Blue Moon was coming to be a huge
success.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>Four hours Johnny worked at top speed.
Dishing up ice cream, pouring out steaming
hot chocolate, slicing buns for hot dogs, directing
his three helpers, he found little time
for thinking. When, however, the last straggler
had wandered through the open door and
Aunt Mandy had said, &ldquo;If you all don ob-ject,
I&rsquo;ll be agoin&rsquo; on home,&rdquo; Johnny found time to
think of many things. As his eyes moved
swiftly over the place, taking in his three candy
cases, all but emptied in a single evening, as
they rested on the polished counter and the
shining table, a feeling of joy and pride swept
over him. He had said to the hostile world,
&ldquo;Here I am, ready for work. Shove over.
Make me a place.&rdquo; The world had answered,
&ldquo;There is no place.&rdquo; He had replied, &ldquo;O. K.
then I&rsquo;ll make myself a place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had done just that. The Blue Moon was
a success, would be more and more of a success
in the months to come. It had become an
institution, and part of old Hillcrest. Yes, he,
Johnny Thompson, was a part of something
big and fine. It was wonderful, this association
with some of the finest young people in
the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made a place,&rdquo; he whispered proudly. &ldquo;A
place for myself and Kentucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kentucky, the name awakened him. How
was Kentucky? He must know. Slamming
the stove drafts shut, snapping off the lights,
twirling the key in the door, he was away to
the heating plant, hoping to find Dynamite.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>He was not disappointed. &ldquo;It might be
worse,&rdquo; the big boy said soberly. &ldquo;General
shock and one cracked rib. The doc has him
all taped up. Sure can&rsquo;t play next Saturday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he added slowly, &ldquo;is not so bad.
We can afford to take one more licking. But
when it comes to week after next, when we go
up against our ancient rival, Naperville, for
that final game of the season, and, like as not,
for the championship, then, if Kentucky&rsquo;s out
for good, it&rsquo;s going to be just too bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do the best we can for him,&rdquo; said
Johnny. &ldquo;And here&rsquo;s hoping the best is good
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dynamite&rsquo;s dire prophecy regarding the St.
Regis game was not without foundation. At
the very beginning, playing on their own field,
St. Regis took the lead. But then, with two
&ldquo;pony&rdquo; teams pitted against one another and
with Hillcrest&rsquo;s best pony in the paddock, or
rather on the bench, what chance did they
have? Hillcrest took a good licking and Kentucky
took it hardest of all. At the end the
score stood 21 to 6.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>Seeing how down-hearted the mountain boy
was, Johnny Thompson said, &ldquo;Never mind,
Kentucky old boy, about the middle of the
week, when trade is lightest, we&rsquo;ll step on the
starter and go spinning back to our beloved
hills. There are some things down there I&rsquo;d
like to look into a little further. What do you
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Kentucky, with a broad grin,
&ldquo;will be somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo; His grin was even broader
than Johnny had expected it to be. Little
wonder, for this boy had thoughts all his own.
He was thinking, &ldquo;Doc won&rsquo;t let me go out on
the field and practice, &rsquo;fraid I&rsquo;ll get this old
rib bumped again. Down in the mountains
Doc has nothing to say about it. I&rsquo;ll just slip
out into the moonlight for a little practice with
old Nicodemus.&rdquo; He chuckled a wise chuckle.
But to Johnny he said never a word.</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon of that week they
were on their way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>Our minds are strange. For some of us a
place left behind is a place forgotten. It was
so with Johnny Thompson. The moment that
Stone Mountain loomed up before him, Hillcrest
was forgotten. Like the passing of the
morning mist, the Blue Moon, Red Dynamite,
the entire football team and all that was Hillcrest
at its best, were forgotten. At once his
mind was filled with other scenes, other problems.
The old mill with its sucking pumps
producing its strange liquid treasure, Donald
Day, poor old Uncle Mose, the ornery and
penny-pinching Blinkey Bill, the proposed
lightning from the blue sky, the aviator down
in the valley with his new type of motor, all
these clamored for first place in his imaginative
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kentucky,&rdquo; he said, throwing back his
square young shoulders, &ldquo;life is wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure is,&rdquo; Kentucky agreed. He was
thinking of old Nicodemus and the moon that
would hang like a Japanese lantern over the
hills that night.</p>
<p>And so they glided on down past Stone
Mountain to the mouth of Pounding Mill
Creek and fresh adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br />TEN GALLONS OF AIR</h2>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s first visit on the following
morning was at the old mill. He found
Donald Day busy as usual, compressing liquid
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to see you, Johnny,&rdquo; were his welcoming
words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Johnny grinned. &ldquo;Had a bolt of
lightning from the blue sky yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, Johnny, but soon,&rdquo; Donald smiled
a mysterious smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the chance of helping you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine, Johnny, when the time comes. Just
now though, there&rsquo;s something else you might
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Johnny was ready for anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got something for the aviator down there
in the valley. Want to take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure do!&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s reply was full of enthusiasm.
&ldquo;He helped us take your grandfather
to the hospital. Never forget that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We sure won&rsquo;t, Johnny. Just now he wants
some liquid air. This is the tenth order I have
received from him. He wants ten gallons. It&rsquo;s
ready, so if you&rsquo;ll take it down, you&rsquo;ll be doing
me a great favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liquid air,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;What does he
want with liquid air?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. Going to peddle it, like as not.
Good profit in it. And an airplane&rsquo;s the thing
for carrying it. Gets it there quick so there&rsquo;s
little loss by evaporation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebby that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; Johnny agreed. Down
deep in his mind, however, he did not agree.
He had quite another notion, a very startling
notion it was too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More foot-pounds of energy,&rdquo; he muttered
as he went on his way. &ldquo;Wonder if that could
be true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed the young aviator, as, an
hour later, Johnny appeared with a two wheel
cartload of liquid air. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just wanting that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re really going to use it?&rdquo; Johnny
grinned. &ldquo;I thought so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to use it,&rdquo; the man stared at him.
&ldquo;Sure I am! Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Donald thought you might be going to
peddle it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; the aviator laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be using
a lot of it. Want to stay and watch me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, Johnny found himself
looking at the strangest airplane motor he or
anyone else had even seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does it really use liquid air for fuel?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it does!&rdquo; The aviator had reached for
a small jug of liquid air. &ldquo;Watch and see.
Liquid air and carbon, that&rsquo;s what she eats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You put the liquid air in here and the carbon
here. The mechanism mixes it and throws
it into the combustion chambers in just the
right quantity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a tough time,&rdquo; he straightened up.
&ldquo;Liquid air was so cold it froze up all my
lubricants. But I&rsquo;ve solved that. Got two sets
of feeders. One set is being thawed out by the
exhaust while the other&rsquo;s working. Going to
be great now. Stick around until I get the motor
hooked up and we&rsquo;ll take a ride on air&mdash;liquid
air.&rdquo; He laughed a joyous laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But say!&rdquo; His voice changed. &ldquo;Tell that
boy up at the mill that his grandfather is much
better. Got that word on my short wave wireless.
He&rsquo;ll be coming home soon. Fine thing.
Great old man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never was any finer,&rdquo; Johnny said huskily.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s done a lot for these people. He helped
them to make a living. On Sunday he talked
to them like a father. He told the ones who
have been doing a lot of fighting&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feud fighters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, feuds. He told them they couldn&rsquo;t do
it and be good citizens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right too, exactly right.&rdquo; The aviator
reached for a pair of pliers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; his tone changed. &ldquo;Just give me a
lift shoving this thing into place and we&rsquo;ll be
away before you know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half hour later the airplane rose above
the meadow and soared away. It was a trial
flight and the stout little ship was handled
with greatest care. They climbed far up into
the blue sky but never was the narrow meadow
out of their sight. Johnny knew enough about
flying to realize that from that height, even
though their motor went dead, they could go
gliding down to a safe landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Working perfectly,&rdquo; he shouted in the pilot&rsquo;s
ear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>Just then, as if to give the boy a shock, the
motor let out a sudden pop-pop-pop. The aviator,
after touching a lever, tapped his head
with his knuckles as much as to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knock on wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half hour later they came soaring back
to earth. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s working.&rdquo; The pilot heaved a
sigh of content. &ldquo;Two or three more days and
I&rsquo;ll be ready to cross the continent. Tell that
boy at the mill to freeze me up a good lot of
liquid air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll tell him,&rdquo; Johnny agreed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s
wonderful!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Riding through
the air with only air and carbon for fuel. Is
it practical, a truly great thing? Will people
everywhere be using liquid air for airplane fuel
before long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o,&rdquo; the pilot replied slowly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
not. Fuel that costs two or three dollars a gallon
is hardly practical. Besides, there may be
other drawbacks that haven&rsquo;t appeared yet.
How will the steel parts stand freezing and
thawing? Things like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s just a sort of sporting proposition,&rdquo;
he added. &ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;m just sort of
playing at it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s this much about it though,&rdquo; the
drawl left his voice. &ldquo;On a very long trip it
would be wonderful, this liquid air fuel! It has
more power per pound than any fuel you can
carry. And that means more miles. I shouldn&rsquo;t
wonder,&rdquo; he grinned broadly, &ldquo;but that if they
get this stratosphere flying worked out perfectly,
some fellow will one of these days load
his motor with liquid air and circle the globe
in a non-stop flight. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take you on a regular
trip some of these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not around the world,&rdquo; Johnny
chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Not quite yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truth was, this &ldquo;regular trip&rdquo; was to be taken
much sooner than they imagined, and for
a very important reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I better get going,&rdquo; Johnny said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Don&rsquo;t forget to tell that boy
about his grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny did not forget. He hurried away at
once to break the good news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Donald smiled his gratitude
when the message had been delivered. &ldquo;That
takes a load off my shoulders. Now, perhaps I
can get my mind on other things.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Uncle Mose and Blinkey Bill come
first,&rdquo; Donald&rsquo;s brow wrinkled. &ldquo;Blinkey Bill
claims he owns the coal rights on Uncle Mose&rsquo;s
land. He&rsquo;s stopped him mining coal there. Old
tight wad! That&rsquo;s making things hard for
Uncle Mose. No coal to mine. Poor old Mose
and his wife will starve. Think of it, the oldest
couple in the mountains! You&rsquo;d think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing fair about it,&rdquo; Johnny
broke in. &ldquo;I doubt if Blinkey Bill owns the
coal rights on that land. If he does, his father
got it by some sharper methods that Uncle
Mose didn&rsquo;t understand. And Uncle Mose
didn&rsquo;t get a thing for it, you can be sure of
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thing is,&rdquo; Donald turned to Johnny, &ldquo;you
and Ballard have got to play your part, sort of
work up the psychology, my professor would
say. This evening,&rdquo; his voice dropped, &ldquo;just before
dark, you boys just happen by Blinkey
Bill&rsquo;s house and stop to talk. He&rsquo;ll say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jest come up and set a while and rest yourself,&rsquo;
he always does. So you just go up and
set.&rdquo; He laughed a low laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And while you set,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;you start
talking about Uncle Mose, what a hard time
he has, how old he is and how wicked it would
be if any one would take a mean advantage of
him. Just get Blinkey Bill to feeling about as
low down as the hind leg of a glow worm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then just casually,&rdquo; he took a long breath,
&ldquo;just slow like, as if it sort of occurred to you,
say something about how deadly lightning can
be, especially when it comes out of a clear sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sky&rsquo;s going to be real clear tonight,&rdquo;
he added as if it were an afterthought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Johnny agreed, guessing he knew
what would happen. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be uncommonly
clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometime later, an hour after darkness had
fallen, Johnny and Ballard found themselves
seated on hickory-bottomed chairs on Blinkey
Bill&rsquo;s porch. They had been there for some
time and had talked considerable, especially
about poor Uncle Mose. Blinkey Bill had listened
and as he listened, had appeared to
shrink deeper and deeper into his chair. When,
however, Johnny said quite suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure is queer about lightning&mdash;the kind
that comes out of a clear sky!&rdquo; Blinkey Bill sat
up quite suddenly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you all are a sayin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said it&rsquo;s queer about lightning out of a
clear sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe there ever was any,&rdquo; Ballard
put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure there were!&rdquo; Blinkey Bill&rsquo;s eyes were
popping. &ldquo;I saw hit my own self. Knocked
me down. Might nigh kilt me, it did. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke short off. His eyes shone like stars
as he stared at the crest of the mountain, for
there, sharp and distinct against a clear, black
night sky, a flash of light went zig-zagging
away. It was followed ten seconds later by a
low, rumbling roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lightnin&rsquo;! Lightnin&rsquo; out of a clear sky!&rdquo;
The look on Blinkey Bill&rsquo;s face at that moment
was a terrible thing to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does sort of seem like lightning,&rdquo; Johnny
said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seem like!&rdquo; Ballard had not been let into
the entire secret. &ldquo;It IS lightning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shore! Shore hit&rsquo;s lightnin&rsquo;!&rdquo; Blinkey Bill
was trembling like a cottonwood leaf in a high
wind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>Once more there came the zig-zag flash
across the sky. This time the roar that followed
was fairly deafening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s judgment!&rdquo; Blinkey Bill mumbled.
&ldquo;Judgment of the Lord almighty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you all been a doin&rsquo;?&rdquo; Ballard asked,
dropping into native speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;. Not nary a thing! I tell you
nary a thing!&rdquo; Blinkey Bill fairly screamed
these words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about Uncle Mose and his coal mine?&rdquo;
Johnny suggested softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That no-count old&mdash;&rdquo; Blinkey Bill broke
off. Mouth open, eyes staring, he once again
took in that terrifying spectacle that, so far as
he knew, was a special act of God, a bolt from
the blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you the truth,&rdquo; he was fairly whimpering
now. &ldquo;Fact is I ain&rsquo;t for sartin&rsquo; sure my
Pappy bought in them coal rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; suggested Johnny, &ldquo;you better let
Uncle Mose mine his coal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon as how I orter do that,&rdquo; Blinkey
Bill agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait. I&rsquo;ll write it out.&rdquo; Johnny drew pencil
and paper from his pocket and pretended to
write. Truth was he and Donald had carefully
prepared the release on Uncle Mose&rsquo;s coal
rights hours before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he exclaimed at last. &ldquo;You sign
right there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now wait a leetle,&rdquo; Blinkey Bill began to
hedge. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t plumb sure fer sartin that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the most dazzling flash of all zig-zagged
its way across the blue-black sky. It
was followed at once by a terrific roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! Here!&rdquo; Blinkey Bill&rsquo;s voice trembled
so he could scarcely speak. &ldquo;Here! Gimme
that air paper. Hit&rsquo;s proper to sign hit,
plumb proper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the paper was signed. The boys departed
and old Uncle Mose&rsquo;s coal mine was saved for
all time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br />WITH THE SPEED OF A WHIRLWIND</h2>
<p>Later that night had anyone happened
along the mountain trail above Colonel
Crider&rsquo;s pasture, as Johnny Thompson had
done one night some time before, they might
have seen as on that other night, two dark figures
darting back and forth across old Nicodemus&rsquo;
pen. One led, the other followed but
not once did the one catch up with the other.
At last, the one that always led, climbed up
the side of the pen to go tumbling over it and
disappear in the shadows that lie thick along
the Stone Mountain trail in the moonlight. The
Kentucky football star had been having a little
practice. If one were to judge by his action it
might be proper to say that Nicodemus had enjoyed
this nocturnal adventure quite as much
as the boy.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; Johnny was smiling as he handed a
folded paper to Donald next day. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the
release for Uncle Mose&rsquo;s coal rights. It worked
like a charm. But tell me, how did you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not so difficult when you know how.&rdquo; Donald
pointed to a long, irregularly formed glass
tube in the corner. It was in three sections.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a transformer up there on the ridge.
The line carries power to a coal mine. Hope
they don&rsquo;t arrest me for stealing power. Guess
they won&rsquo;t if I tell my story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he went on after a chuckle, &ldquo;I
had some gas extracted from liquid air in those
tubes. When they were all connected and hung
down from a tall tree they made quite a long,
zig-zagging line. By running a powerful current
through the gas in the tubes, I was able
to give you a fairly accurate picture of what
lightning is at its best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a neon sign really,&rdquo; he added quietly.
&ldquo;Sort of irreverent to imitate God&rsquo;s wrath perhaps,
but I trust I&rsquo;ll be forgiven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s tone told his admiration.
&ldquo;But how about the thunder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simple enough, but costly. Nice little explosion
of liquid air mixed with carbon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an artist in your line,&rdquo; Johnny complimented
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; the other boy agreed. &ldquo;Also
something of a nut. Rather wild sort of way
to get what you want. I shouldn&rsquo;t care to recommend
it as a regular thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later that day Johnny found himself in his
car threading his way over a difficult passage.
The hour for his departure with Ballard for
Hillcrest and the great game on the morrow
was rapidly approaching. He did want one
more word with the aviator down in the valley
so he had decided to have a try at reaching him
in his car.</p>
<p>This try was to end in disaster. Just as he
was negotiating the last twenty rods of the
trail something went wrong with his brakes.
He shot down a short, steep slope, took a sudden
shock that all but sent him through the
windshield, then, with a sinking heart felt his
right front wheel crumple from the impact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;No train until
morning! No car available. And tomorrow&rsquo;s
the big game. Hillcrest will be defeated without
Old Kentucky. What&rsquo;s worse, Kentucky
will die if he is not there. Could anything be
worse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you&rsquo;re in a fix,&rdquo; a friendly voice said.
The speaker was close at hand. Johnny looked
up. It was the young aviator.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a terrible mess!&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s voice carried
conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny told of his dilemma, told it as he had
never told anything before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why not let me fly you over?&rdquo; the other
suggested simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With your liquid air motor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose it fails?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t fail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; Johnny gripped his hand. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
go get Kentucky and-and thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save that for the end of the trip,&rdquo; the pilot
grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are&mdash;are you,&rdquo; Johnny had been struck by
a sudden thought, &ldquo;could you use a little publicity
on your new type of motor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be thankfully received.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have it,&rdquo; Johnny was away.</p>
<p>On his way to find Kentucky, Johnny
scribbled a note, then thrust it together with
two new paper dollars into Lige Field&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here Lige,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;hop on your
pony and ride like sixty to the Gap. Get this
message off. The change is all yours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Johnny! Thanks a powerful lot!&rdquo;
Lige was away and so was Johnny.</p>
<p>After racing up the creek and over a low
ridge to notify Kentucky of their good-bad
fortune of a wrecked car and a promised airplane
ride, without waiting for the other boy
to pack his bag, he hastened back toward the
meadow and the waiting plane.</p>
<p>On the way he caught up with Donald Day.
&ldquo;Come on along with me to the meadow,&rdquo; he
urged. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re flying back to Hillcrest for tomorrow&rsquo;s
game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy! You&rsquo;re going high-hat in a big way!&rdquo;
Donald exclaimed, increasing his speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Case of necessity,&rdquo; Johnny explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing I wanted to ask you,&rdquo; Johnny
said after a moment of silent marching. &ldquo;What
would happen if you pumped a quantity of
liquid air into a football?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Football would get mighty cold, nearly
freezing, perhaps worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it would expand until it burst. You
can&rsquo;t confine liquid air, at least not in any ordinary
way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;was just what I suspected.
Those fellows played a trick on us. A
player kicked the football into the bleachers,
one of the fans substituted another ball he&rsquo;d
just given a shot of liquid air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange sort of thing to do,&rdquo; Donald&rsquo;s brow
wrinkled. &ldquo;Tell me about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny did tell him about that football game
and the bursting ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer sense of humor,&rdquo; was Donald&rsquo;s comment.
&ldquo;Lost them the game, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least they lost it,&rdquo; Johnny chuckled.
&ldquo;Hope there&rsquo;ll be no monkey shines tomorrow.
Guess there won&rsquo;t be. Good clean, hard-fighting
crowd, that Naperville team. But they&rsquo;ve
got to take a licking. And they will if only the
old Doc will let Kentucky play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping!&rdquo; said Donald. &ldquo;And here we
are at the meadow. There&rsquo;s Ballard coming
over the ridge. You can&rsquo;t stop that boy. He&rsquo;s
a great fellow. My grandfather is very fond
of him. You&rsquo;re doing wonders for him, Johnny.
Got to be getting back. Here&rsquo;s luck for tomorrow!&rdquo;
The young scientist gripped Johnny&rsquo;s
hand. Then he was away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>Five minutes later with their strange, air-burning
motor hitting hard on every cylinder,
the boys, with their pilot, felt themselves being
lifted high into the bluest of blue skies that so
often smile down upon the Blue Ridge Mountains
of Kentucky.</p>
<p>To the inexperienced person it is impossible
to judge the speed with which an airplane travels.
With no trees, no telephone poles, no nothing
speeding past him, he is likely to think of
himself standing still in mid-air. Not so Johnny
Thompson. He had ridden in many planes
and under every possible condition. He had
come to have a sort of sixth sense. This was a
feeling for speed. As he now sped through the
air he became wildly excited for he was, he
knew, travelling faster than ever before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the fuel,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Liquid air
and carbon.&rdquo; Stealing a glance over the pilot&rsquo;s
shoulder, he watched with amazement as the
speed indicator rose from two hundred to two-fifty,
then to three hundred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a little tail wind, we&rsquo;d beat the clock,&rdquo;
he chuckled. &ldquo;Be there before we know it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>They were, but not until Johnny had time
for a few serious thoughts about tomorrow&rsquo;s
game. That game meant a great deal. For
Hillcrest it meant a final triumph over an ancient
rival. All the old grads would be there.
Some had wired for reserve seats from a distance
of a thousand miles. Some, like himself,
were to come by plane. Johnny thrilled at
the thought.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes for a moment and into his
mind&rsquo;s vision there floated the &ldquo;Crimson
Flood,&rdquo; the team: Stagger Weed, Tony Blazes,
Jack Rabbit Jones, Artie Stark, Punch Dickman&mdash;all
marched before him. And after that,
most important of all, Red Dynamite and Old
Kentucky. &ldquo;Good Old Dynamite!&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;And Kentucky! They must win!
They&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what was this? Had something gone
wrong with the motor? A chill set him shuddering.
They were circling for a landing.</p>
<p>Then he laughed. Seizing Kentucky&rsquo;s hand,
he gripped it hard. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here!&rdquo; he shouted.
&ldquo;Kentucky, we are here! The emergency landing
a mile from Hillcrest is right beneath us.&rdquo;
And so it was. They had come with the speed
of the wind, no ordinary wind either, the speed
of a whirlwind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>Fast as they had come, the news of their
strange and daring flight with a new and little-tried
motor had preceded them. Johnny&rsquo;s message
had come through. A crowd had gathered
to see them land. In that crowd were reporters
and camera men. Their pictures would be in
all the morning papers. Johnny, Kentucky,
and the inventor of this new motor would be
there. All this would be grand publicity for the
inventor and his motor. It would help to swell
the crowd at tomorrow&rsquo;s game. Johnny was
glad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br />IN THE GRIP OF A GIANT</h2>
<p>That evening, just before nine, the team
was gathered in the back room of the Blue
Moon for a last look at unusual plays and a
cheering word from the coach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Football is a game of war.&rdquo; The coach
spoke earnestly. &ldquo;Back there in those hard
days of 1918 when some of us paid a long visit
to France, we practiced long weeks before we
were sent into the trenches. That practice was
real, the realest thing any of us had ever
known. It had to be. When, in bayonet practice,
we went after a dummy&mdash;a gunny-sack
stuffed with straw&mdash;that was, to us, not a sack
but a man. It must be a man, for tomorrow,
next day, the day after, we would go over the
top. Then it WOULD be a man. Everything
must be real.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Football is like that, you must go after
things hard. You must buck the line in scrimmage
as you do in a real game.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Football is like war in other ways. If a
battalion cannot go through the enemy&rsquo;s line,
it attempts to go around him. If an army is too
light for ground fighting, it takes to the air.
You do the same thing in football.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In war, practice is not enough. When the
zero hour arrives, a soldier must have a clear
head, his body must be fit, he must have his
nerves under control. Only so can he win and
live.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys have practiced hard. You have
given the best there is in you. You are prepared.
Tomorrow you must be at your best.
Keep your heads. Get a good grip on your
nerves. Don&rsquo;t let the other fellows get your
goat. Go in to win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea! Yea! Hear! Hear! Hear!&rdquo; came in a
roar from the team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; the coach smiled. &ldquo;And now&mdash;&rdquo;
he broke off to stand at attention for a period
of seconds. Had his keen ears caught some unusual
sound? Johnny, who sat in a corner close
to a half open window, would have sworn he
caught a faint rustle from the outside. &ldquo;But
who&rsquo;d be around this time of night?&rdquo; he asked
himself. &ldquo;And after all, what does it matter?
All Hillcrest is loyal to our team.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; the coach went on at last, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll go
through two or three plays rather rapidly.&rdquo;
Picking up a bit of chalk, he stepped to the
blackboard. &ldquo;This play,&rdquo; he drew circles rapidly,
&ldquo;is one of balanced formation. You&rsquo;ll
likely try it after a couple of long, and probably
unsuccessful passes. In the play&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he paused to listen. This time Johnny
did hear some sound from without, he was sure
of it. &ldquo;Might be Panther Eye&rsquo;s black giant!&rdquo;
he told himself with a shudder. &ldquo;But then,&rdquo; he
asked himself, &ldquo;is there a black giant?&rdquo; He
rather doubted it. He had come to think of
that giant as a black ghost. Panther Eye too
might be a ghost for all he knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this play,&rdquo; the coach began once more,
&ldquo;Artie passes the ball from quarter to Punch
at full. Punch poses as for a long pass. But
Dynamite swings round close behind the line
of scrimmage and the ball is thrown to him.
In the meantime, Rabbit and Tony dash round
left end in position to receive a pass. Dynamite,
you go through the line for whatever
gain you can, then, if there is a chance, shoot
a pass to Rabbit or Tony. After that,&rdquo; he
grinned, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s your game. Let your conscience
be your guide.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got that?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea! Yea! Yea! You bet!&rdquo; came from every
corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Now this next one is a trick play.
It&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not finish, for at that moment, from
somewhere outside, there came a most unearthly
scream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Every man was on
his feet.</p>
<p>They dashed to the window just in time to
witness a short, sharp struggle between two
shadowy figures. One was of ordinary size,
the other a person of huge proportions, a giant.
Apparently it was the smaller person who had
screamed, for now, as he half broke away, he
let out one more blood-curdling cry.</p>
<p>The next instant he was free and dashing
toward the front of the Blue Moon. Ten seconds
later some heavy object launched itself
against the locked door of the place and an
agonizing voice cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me in! For God&rsquo;s sake let me in. He&rsquo;ll
kill me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>There was no opportunity for letting him in.
Before anyone could reach the front of the
large room, he broke the door open, and fell
panting on the floor.</p>
<p>Walking calmly past the prostrate figure,
Johnny stepped out into the moonlight and
took a sweeping survey of the surrounding territory.
Nothing unusual was to be seen. The
giant had vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never-the-less there was a giant!&rdquo; he said
slowly. &ldquo;Pant&rsquo;s big, hooked-nose giant, I&rsquo;ll be
bound. But why, I wonder, was he man-handling
that other fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reason was not far to seek, at least Johnny
felt that way about it, for the moment he
laid eyes on the frightened stranger, who by
this time had risen from the floor, he recognized
in him, the sneering Naperville sophomore,
the very one who had come near to causing
Kentucky&rsquo;s downfall.</p>
<p>Every boy in the room had recognized this
fellow, the coach as well, but&mdash;Johnny thought
this a trifle strange&mdash;not one of them all gave
any indication that they knew him. For that
matter, however, the boys seemed willing
enough to let Coach Dizney do the talking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>As for the stranger, Johnny thought he had
never seen anyone so thoroughly frightened.
Eyes wild, nostrils widely distended, lips far
apart, he stood there panting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, son?&rdquo; the coach&rsquo;s tone was disarming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he would have killed me,&rdquo; the boy
spoke with difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The big, black giant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Giant?&rdquo; The coach looked at him strangely.
&ldquo;We have no giants in Hillcrest. Must
have escaped from a circus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, I&mdash;I guess that was it,&rdquo; the boy
seemed relieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what were you doing out there?&rdquo; the
coach asked quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just&mdash;why, just passing&mdash;just walking by.&rdquo;
The stranger appeared slightly confused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no sidewalk there,&rdquo; the coach said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; he turned about, &ldquo;suppose you get
the Chief on the wire. Tell him to run over
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O. K.!&rdquo; Johnny was on his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; the stranger gave the coach an uncertain
look. &ldquo;Well you see I&mdash;I got lost so
I&mdash;I just sort of cut across.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>The coach seemed to have lost interest in
the conversation. &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;a
good hot drink would brace you up. Cup of
hot chocolate perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kentucky,&rdquo; the coach turned to smile, &ldquo;one
cup of hot chocolate on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One cup of hot chocolate coming up.&rdquo; The
look on Kentucky&rsquo;s face was a study. Was he
amused? Was he afraid, perhaps, that he
might be tempted to throw the drink in the
stranger&rsquo;s face? Who could say? Enough that
he did his duty as host faultlessly.</p>
<p>There came the stamping of feet and the
Chief of Police arrived. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he demanded.
The stranger stared at him, gulped
down the last of his cocoa, then swallowed
hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This boy says he saw a giant that broke
loose from a circus.&rdquo; Was there a twinkle in
the coach&rsquo;s eye?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dangerous,&rdquo; said the Chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he shook me,&rdquo; the boy stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad! Very bad!&rdquo; said the Chief. &ldquo;Then
what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He broke in the door to this place,&rdquo; said the
coach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The giant?&rdquo; the Chief appeared to stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This boy,&rdquo; the coach replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this boy! So!&rdquo; The Chief&rsquo;s face was
sober. &ldquo;Breakin&rsquo;-an&rsquo;-enterin&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s it. Thirty
days at least, I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo; the boy&rsquo;s face paled, &ldquo;he was
after me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any confirmation?&rdquo; the Chief looked about.
&ldquo;Johnny, did you see him, this &rsquo;ere escaped
giant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went out and looked around,&rdquo; Johnny
said truthfully, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see a soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Breakin&rsquo;-an&rsquo;-enterin&rsquo;,&rdquo; the Chief repeated
slowly. &ldquo;Pretty bad. Thirty days, I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Chief,&rdquo; the coach appeared to protest,
&ldquo;that would be rather hard. Perhaps&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got any relatives, son?&rdquo; he turned to the
intruder. &ldquo;Anyone a hundred miles away or
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes I got an uncle in Springer,&rdquo; the
boy&rsquo;s tone was eager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you stay there three days if you
were sent there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes I would,&rdquo; his eagerness increased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about it, Chief?&rdquo; The coach smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you say, coach.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! Will you see him on his way, Chief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be glad to, coach. Come on, son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief and his prisoner passed through
the door, to enter a car and go rolling away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snooping, that&rsquo;s what he was,&rdquo; said Dynamite
indignantly. &ldquo;Trying to get on to our
plays and signals. Oh well, we&rsquo;ll not be
bothered with him tomorrow, and, old son,&rdquo;
he turned to Kentucky, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t have to
choke him for calling names. He won&rsquo;t be
there to call &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shore am right smart &rsquo;bliged to hear that,&rdquo;
Kentucky drawled. &ldquo;That there is the name-callin&rsquo;est
feller I might-nigh ever seed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that every boy in the room burst into a
hearty laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said the coach thoughtfully,
&ldquo;that was taking an unfair advantage of the
enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it!&rdquo; Dynamite exploded. &ldquo;They
beat us out of that last game because he wasn&rsquo;t
penalized for a foul. Besides, all spies should
be shot at sunrise. You let him off easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you think so,&rdquo; the coach heaved a
sigh of relief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what about this giant?&rdquo; he wrinkled
his brow. &ldquo;How many of you really saw him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;sure! Sure we saw him,&rdquo; came in
a chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I might shed a little light on that.
All of you get set for a lemon soda and I&rsquo;ll
entertain you with a yarn not one of you&rsquo;ll
believe.&rdquo; It was Johnny who spoke.</p>
<p>While they drank their soda, Johnny told
the story of Panther Eye, the giant, and the
kidnapped girl, told it through to the end, or
at least, as far as the story had gone. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo;
he ended, &ldquo;can you beat that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t even tie it,&rdquo; the coach said solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; the coach rose, &ldquo;big day tomorrow.
Time to start pounding your ears.&rdquo;
The team filed silently from the room.</p>
<p>Later that night Johnny received a strange
visitor. The last freshman to drop in for a
chocolate bar had left the door ajar. Since the
evening was mild and the room was warm,
Johnny had not troubled to close it. Instead
he sat by the stove musing on many things.
In his imagination he heard again the roar of
a bear, the loud boom of an explosion, the roar
of a thousand voices shouting for Hillcrest and
victory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Victory,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Tomorrow&rsquo;s the
day. Will they win? And Kentucky, will he
have a part in it?&rdquo; In his mind&rsquo;s eyes once
more he saw them marching by, the team:
Rabbit Jones, Tony Blazes, Stagger Weed,
Punch Dickman, Artie Stark, Dynamite, Old
Kentucky, and all the rest. What a fine bunch
they were! And what a season it had been!
His blood warmed at thought of it. &ldquo;To be a
little part of a big thing like Hillcrest College.
Ah! That was something! It was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His thoughts broken short off, he sat there
staring at the apparition that stood in the
opening of the door. A girl, she was tall and
gracefully slender. And how fair she was! Her
hair seemed mere moonbeams, her face was
like shimmering silk. Was she a ghost? Johnny
started but did not move. He had met up
with ghosts of a sort before and had found
them harmless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; the girl&rsquo;s voice was low, musical.
&ldquo;Are you Johnny Thompson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking,&rdquo; Johnny was on his feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And are you a friend of a person they call
Panther Eyes?&rdquo; Her English, though perfect,
was spoken with a foreign accent. Johnny was
plagued by the notion that he had seen her
somewhere before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;Panther Eye and I have
been great friends. Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl accepted the chair offered to her
then, turning eagerly toward him she said,
&ldquo;Can you tell me where he is&mdash;this Panther
Eye? It is important that I should know. He
saved me from death, worse than death&mdash;I
wish to thank him. My father would reward
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; Johnny smiled, &ldquo;happened in Ethiopia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes,&rdquo; her tone was eager. &ldquo;You know
about it. He has told you. Where is he?&rdquo; She
glanced hurriedly about the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not here,&rdquo; Johnny said. &ldquo;I do not
know where he is, may never know again. He&rsquo;s
that sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; The girl voiced her disappointment.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&mdash;that&rsquo;s really terrible. You see,&rdquo; she
went on, &ldquo;Father is&mdash;you might say&mdash;rather
well to do. Oil and all that. He went to Ethiopia
to study oil prospects. He found a valley
there and came to love it. He sent for me. We
lived there happily. And then&mdash;then&mdash;&rdquo; she
covered her eyes for an instant. &ldquo;Then that
terrible black giant carried me away. And&mdash;and
your friend saved me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a black giant around here,&rdquo;
Johnny said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of that. Could he have
been the same man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! God forbid!&rdquo; the girl laughed uncertainly.
&ldquo;That was our servant. We brought
him from Africa. He&mdash;why, come to think of
it, there is a resemblance. But he&mdash;Oh my!
No. He&rsquo;s not the man!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she explained as Johnny gave her
a questioning look, &ldquo;we set Hassie, that&rsquo;s our
servant, to hunt up your friend, Panther Eye.
He did a good piece of work&mdash;almost. In the
end though, he allowed him to slip away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would have had a hard time stopping
him,&rdquo; Johnny chuckled. &ldquo;Even if he&rsquo;d known
everything, he would have vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he leaned forward, &ldquo;Panther Eye
just wanted to take you back so you would be
in that picture again, the broad, green pasture,
the cows, the banana field, and all that. When
you were back he was satisfied. He isn&rsquo;t romantic,
not in the least. And as for money,
he never appears to need it much. So&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s not much use looking.&rdquo; The girlish
figure drooped. &ldquo;I&mdash;I did so want to thank
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might leave your address.&rdquo; Johnny
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Yes. So I might. Will you loan me
pencil and paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Johnny stood close to the girl while she
wrote down the address, he became conscious
of two things&mdash;that she was no ghost but a
real person, and that she was really quite
charming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; she favored him with a rare
smile, &ldquo;you will come and see us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;yes, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held out her hand. Johnny took it in
his own. It was a good firm hand. Johnny
liked the touch of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said I would,&rdquo; he whispered, as she disappeared
through the door. &ldquo;But will I? I
wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; he thought with a thrill one
minute later, &ldquo;tomorrow is the big day.&rdquo; Already
the mysterious girl and her giant escort
were crowded from his mind. The team, the
game, these filled his entire horizon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>One more recollection slipped into Johnny&rsquo;s
mind and out again before he fell asleep that
night. A half hour after their landing at Hillcrest
he had come upon Kentucky practicing
football all by himself. He was dropping the
ball and picking it up, bouncing it on the
ground and catching it, retrieving it in every
manner imaginable. One thing was strange,
the ball was soaking wet and the field was dry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d your ball get wet?&rdquo; he had asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I soaked it,&rdquo; Kentucky dropped it, then fell
upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Johnny had asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Kentucky had replied quite soberly,
&ldquo;the weather man predicts dampness for tomorrow.
If it rains, somebody&rsquo;s going to drop
the ball. And I&rsquo;ll be ready to pick it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t miss much, that boy,&rdquo; Johnny
murmured to himself just before he fell asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXI</span>
<br />DYNAMITE TAKES IT ON THE CHIN</h2>
<p>Never before had there been such excitement
about a Hillcrest football game.
By one o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, Hillcrest was
deserted. Coaches, busses, trucks and private
cars had been forced into service. All Hillcrest,
professors, students, men, women, boys,
and girls, everyone journeyed to Naperville
where the game was to be played.</p>
<p>When the time for the kick-off came, they
were all there. Old grads were there too, hundreds
of them. One man had journeyed all the
way from New York. Crimson banners and
pennants fluttered in the breeze. The College
band roared, boomed and blared then settled
down to, &ldquo;Hail to Hillcrest!&rdquo; Ah, yes, it was
to be one glorious occasion.</p>
<p>A fine misty rain was blowing in from the
east. But what of that? Blankets, heavy coats,
and ulsters defied the weather. As for the
team, they were all pepped up for the battle.
Weather meant nothing to them. Bumps,
bruises, even cuts would mean nothing to
them. Nothing short of a broken leg could
stop them today.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>Today was the day of days. Year after year
they had gone down to defeat. Today? Today!
Just wait and see.</p>
<p>One thought disturbed Dave Powers as he
took his place. Old Kentucky was in his suit
but his bright, new crimson jersey did not
shine out from the field. Instead it was hidden
beneath a heavy gray blanket. Kentucky was
on the bench. There, shivering from the cold,
excitement, and bitter disappointment, he
awaited the kick-off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your rib is about healed,&rdquo; the doctor had
said to him. &ldquo;However, if you should go into
the game, and be tackled and thrown hard, it
might result in permanent injuries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, doctor&rsquo;s orders were doctor&rsquo;s orders,
but to Kentucky, had it not been for his teammates,
they would have meant nothing. What
were a few broken bones to the loss of the
year&rsquo;s game of games? It was Dynamite who
had said, &ldquo;You stay out until I need you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But promise me,&rdquo; Kentucky pleaded, &ldquo;if
the battle goes against you and if you think I
can help, promise you&rsquo;ll let me in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Help, kid?&rdquo; Dynamite had exclaimed. &ldquo;Of
course you could help. You and I could lick
that Naperville bunch all by our lonesomes.
And will I holler if we are getting the worst
of it? You better believe I will, son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the same, as Dynamite went into the
game it was with a wordless prayer that little
Kentucky might not be needed.</p>
<p>From the very start it was a thrilling game.
From the first, too, Dynamite was to recall
the words of Kentucky&rsquo;s passed on by Johnny:
&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s going to drop the ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naperville led off with a great kick. Punch,
who received the ball, was tackled almost at
once, on the Hillcrest thirty-yard line. On two
line plunges, Hillcrest picked up seven yards.
Then, as Bud Tucker, who played in Kentucky&rsquo;s
place at half, came round the left end,
he was hit hard and thrown. The ball leaped
from his grasp and was recovered by a Naperville
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! Ha! Big joke!&rdquo; one of the opponents
yelled. They had heard this from a defeated
team. Now they evidently meant to use it
against Hillcrest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>To have the ball in the opponent&rsquo;s hands on
one&rsquo;s own thirty-seven-yard line at the start
of a game is no joke. The hard-hitting Naperville
steam roller crushed the Hillcrest line
again and again. &ldquo;First down and ten&mdash;&rdquo; and
scarcely a moment later once again, &ldquo;First
down and ten&mdash;&rdquo; From the bleachers came a
roar like the breaking of a wild sea:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold that line! Hold that line! Hold that
line!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kentucky sat like a mummy in his blanket,
shuddering and mumbling to himself.</p>
<p>Then, when it seemed that a touchdown was
inevitable, once again, &ldquo;somebody dropped the
ball.&rdquo; This time it was little Artie Stark who
recovered. Hillcrest&rsquo;s ball on their own thirteen-yard
line. A quick huddle, a sudden snapping
of the ball, a ducking of the head by
Punch Dickman, as if to run with it, then a
leaping upward like the rise of a submarine,
and a quick kick that, catching the opponents
off their guard, sent the ball rolling, all unmolested
to Naperville&rsquo;s ten-yard line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo! Bravo!&rdquo; Shedding his blanket as
a snake sheds its skin, Kentucky leaped into a
wild Indian dance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>But wait! Again that relentless beating
back. There came line buck after line buck
that Hillcrest&rsquo;s slender line could not withstand.
And after that, with startling suddenness,
forward passes. Naperville, too, had
learned how to invade the air.</p>
<p>One pass was complete, then a second. As
this last pass was caught by a Naperville end,
Dynamite too far away to do more than watch,
saw him go coursing straight down the field.
The ball carrier was followed by his own left-half.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Punch is there,&rdquo; Dynamite congratulated
himself. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll spill him. And how!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had spoken too soon. Punch did spill the
runner, spilled him plenty, but the instant before
Punch struck him, the runner threw a lateral
to the man who followed him. The lateral
was good, Punch went down with the Naperville
end. The trailing Naperville half went
through for a touchdown and the Naperville
rooters burst the head of their big bass drum
from sheer joy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>As for Old Kentucky, he shuddered more
violently than ever. &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; There was a
sharp, girlish voice close at hand. It was Jensie.
She was holding out a small jug filled with
something piping hot. What was in the jug?
Kentucky knew and Jensie too. What did it
matter about the rest? He drank it all and
shuddered no more.</p>
<p>The game went on. Reenforcements were
sent in to the Hillcrest line. This stiffened up
the game. For the rest of that quarter and all
through the second quarter the teams took
turns bucking lines, trying passes, and punting
on the fourth down. Neither team made great
gains. At the end of the half the score stood
at 7-0 against Hillcrest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dynamite,&rdquo; the slim Kentucky boy whispered
tensely as for a moment Dave took a
place beside him on the bench, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t let
them beat us! You just can&rsquo;t. All the old
grads are here. They&rsquo;re burning up for a victory.
I heard one of them say there&rsquo;ll be a
training-table for the team next year if we
win this game. A free training-table, Dynamite!
Think what that&rsquo;ll mean to the boys
who have to work! Let me come in, Dynamite.
Just let me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d bust you in pieces,&rdquo; Dynamite
grumbled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll never touch me,&rdquo; Kentucky&rsquo;s eyes
shone with a strange light. &ldquo;No one ever has
except that once and that&mdash;that was sort of an
accident, you might say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d get you, Kentucky. Those boys are
out for blood. They&rsquo;d murder you and then
Doc would have me up for getting you killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kentucky made no reply. For a full moment
he sat there in silence. &ldquo;All right, Dave,&rdquo;
he said at last. His voice was low and flat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is terrible,&rdquo; Dave thought to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us one more quarter,&rdquo; he pleaded after
a moment of silence. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t score in the
third quarter, you&rsquo;ll go in. I swear it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But one thing,&rdquo; he added in a low tone,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll swear on the Bible you won&rsquo;t let them
tackle you. You&rsquo;ll throw the ball away&mdash;anything
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swear it on a stack of Bibles,&rdquo; Kentucky
grinned happily.</p>
<p>Never had Dave worked, hoped, and prayed
for a scoring punch as he did in that third
quarter. Never did the team back him up with
greater determination. Never had they attempted
such dazzling plays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighty-six,&rdquo; was the first order they received
as they went into a huddle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Eighty-six coming up,&rdquo; Artie Stark gasped.</p>
<p>The team lined up as usual, balanced formation.
Punch Dickman dropped back as if for
a punt. The ball was snapped to him. He held
it for a period of seconds. Dynamite came
sweeping in close behind the line of scrimmage.
Punch shot a shovel pass to him. He
dashed round right end for a gain of five yards.
As he was about to be tackled he shot it to
Rabbit Jones. In the meantime Punch had
followed Dynamite around right end. As Rabbit
saw the end of his own eight-yard break
for liberty, he lateralled it back to Punch and
Punch went forward for a clean twenty yards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea! Yea! Yea!&rdquo; came from the bleachers.
&ldquo;Touchdown! Touchdown! Touchdown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ninety-three,&rdquo; Dynamite whispered. They
were in a huddle and out again. They snapped
into position, five men behind the line, three
a yard back of the line, and two others one
yard farther back. Punch received the ball.
Artie Stark touched the ground. He was behind
the line but this made him a technical
lineman. Bud Talliver, a quarter who was also
temporarily quartered behind the line, took a
short pass from Punch to shoot around left
end for a gain of twelve yards and one more
first down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Repeat,&rdquo; Dynamite whispered in the next
huddle. There was a growing note of confidence
in his tone.</p>
<p>They did repeat and at once met with disaster.
The right guard of the enemy smelled the
play. Somehow he broke through to throw
Bud so hard that the ball bounced out of his
hands and was lost to the enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No good!&rdquo; Dynamite muttered. &ldquo;But we
gotta&rsquo; score! We just gotta&rsquo; score!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are some things in this life that &ldquo;just
must&rdquo; be done but, in the end, because of circumstances
beyond our control, cannot be
done. Hillcrest did not score in that quarter.</p>
<p>Never in all his life had Dynamite been so
disappointed, and never had he looked upon a
more radiant smile than he saw on Kentucky&rsquo;s
face as he approached the bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em,&rdquo; the mountain boy promised.
&ldquo;Two touchdowns in the last quarter.
It&rsquo;s written in the stars. I saw it in my forecast
this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You been studying the stars?&rdquo; Dynamite
asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all written down in a book,&rdquo; Kentucky
was shedding his blanket. The hot drink from
Jensie&rsquo;s brown jug was still coursing through
his veins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Kentucky,&rdquo; Dynamite remonstrated,
&ldquo;perhaps Doc won&rsquo;t let you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; Kentucky grinned broadly.
&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s sick, an auto accident or something.
He left fifteen minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dynamite was sunk. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather we lost the
game,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>By the time the whistle blew he had snapped
out of that mood. Indeed he felt more cheerful
than he had at any time that day. Somehow,
without Kentucky at left half the picture had
not been right. Now it was perfect. &ldquo;All the
same,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not send him through
the line. That would be murder.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>When the hundreds of Hillcrest enthusiasts
saw the slim Kentucky boy rise from his place
on the bench, throw himself through a series
of wild antics to set his blood racing, then
walk quietly to his place behind the line, a
strange silence came over them. This lasted
for some twenty seconds then, like the coming
of a wind storm in summer, there arose
a sound that increased second by second until
at last it filled all the sky. Speaking of it long
after, Punch Dickman said it made his ears
tingle. &ldquo;It was a sign,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;A sure sign
of victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But was it? At the start things went badly.
Three line-bucks failed. The punt that followed
shot straight into the air. Rabbit almost
retrieved the ball, but failed. Fighting like
tigers, the Naperville boys battled their way
to Hillcrest&rsquo;s twenty-yard line.</p>
<p>As Dynamite scanned the faces of his men,
he read their dogged determination, but something
else&mdash;a note of despair. Kentucky was
not like that. He was smiling. His eyes shone.
His lips were parted. He was murmuring
something. Dynamite listened. What he heard
sounded strange: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wet day. Somebody&rsquo;s
going to drop the ball.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>Then the thing happened. On a third down,
the opposing team tried a forward pass. It
struck the receiver&rsquo;s hands, seemed to rest
there a split second, then went spinning into
the air. When it next came to rest, it was in
Kentucky&rsquo;s hands. Like a rushing prairie fire
he streaked down the side line for the far away
goal. Once again, in his own mind, he was in
old Nicodemus&rsquo; pen. It was moonlight. A
shadow approached him, a Naperville man.
Flash! He was past that shadow. Another,
another, and another. Flash, flash, flash, he
was past them all. Two tall, slim shadows
stood out before him&mdash;the goal posts. Flash,
he was past them as well. Then, with a deafening
roar in his ears, he came to rest standing
up. A touchdown for Hillcrest. The kick was
good. The score was tied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t let it stand there,&rdquo; Kentucky said
tensely as Dynamite came up. &ldquo;We must not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wonderful, Kentucky,&rdquo; his team
mate whispered. &ldquo;But think if only one of them
had hit you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dynamite,&rdquo; the Kentucky boy whispered
to his running mate, &ldquo;I had three uncles in the
great war. Only one came back. Do you think
they asked themselves about machine gun bullets
and shells? Football is war, Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;they can&rsquo;t get me.
Nobody can. Even old Nicodemus couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>The battle was begun once more. Enheartened,
Dynamite took a chance. He put his
team through that five-men-back formation.
Somehow it failed. The tackle was thrown for
a loss. Doggedly determined, he tried again.
One more loss. Third down and seventeen to
go. A punt and the enemy had the ball.</p>
<p>By four brilliant forward passes Naperville
carried the ball back to Hillcrest&rsquo;s ten-yard
line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Touchdown! Touchdown! Touchdown!&rdquo;
came from the right bleachers. &ldquo;Hold that
line! Hold that line!&rdquo; came from the left. The
nerves of every player on the field were
stretched to the breaking point. Naperville
charged the line. No gain. They charged
again. No gain. Flash! They shot a pass. It
never reached the receiver. With a leap that
took him high in the air, Dynamite caught the
ball, then plunged head foremost into the oncoming
wall of opponents. Never had a tree
been blasted, nor a mountain exploded more
perfectly than was that line torn away. Never
had Dynamite so deserved his nickname.
He went through everything to their forty-yard
line. There he was downed by the opponent&rsquo;s
safety man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dave,&rdquo; the Kentucky boy whispered, when
next they prepared to line up. &ldquo;One minute to
go. We&mdash;we gotta&rsquo; have that touchdown. You&mdash;you
know how. Don&rsquo;t think of me, Dave.
Forget the bullets and shells. It&rsquo;s war, Dave.
Let&rsquo;s go through together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave set his teeth grimly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a go, Kentucky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they went through. Throwing all the
force of his marvelously developed body in a
line plunge, Dynamite blasted a hole so wide
that both he and Kentucky went through.</p>
<p>But Naperville had been expecting a forward
pass. Her ends and half-backs were a full
twenty yards behind the line. Like a troop of
wild bears, they sprang at the onrushing pair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must not hit him!&rdquo; Dynamite was
saying to himself. &ldquo;They must not.&rdquo; Hurling
himself at the first man, he sent him spinning
to the right. He tipped the second to the left.
The third he missed altogether. And all this
time the slim Kentucky boy hugged the ball
and sped on behind him. Ten&mdash;twenty&mdash;thirty
yards&mdash;for&mdash;</p>
<p>Dynamite struck something that was like a
stone wall. He went down in a heap.</p>
<p>But Kentucky, racing like an escaped colt,
sped on to the winning touchdown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>And then the whistle blew.</p>
<p>The crowd would have rushed upon the field
but officers held them back. All plays begun
before the whistle must be completed. There
must be a trial for the extra point.</p>
<p>As the players began lining up, they missed
Dynamite. Sudden consternation seized them
as they discovered him lying quite senseless on
the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s out for good. That full-back smashed
him. Take him off the field,&rdquo; a doctor ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kentucky, you may call the play,&rdquo; the
coach said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, boys,&rdquo; Kentucky whispered in
the huddle, &ldquo;a line plunge. Make it a good
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A line&mdash;&rdquo; Rabbit Jones who started to
speak, felt a hand over his mouth.</p>
<p>A line plunge it was, and a good one, but
not good enough. The score stood 13 to 7 and
all Hillcrest went wild&mdash;all but one, Dynamite.</p>
<p>They would have picked Kentucky up and
carried him on their shoulders, those Hillcrest
fans, but the boy would not have it. &ldquo;Dynamite,&rdquo;
he shouted. &ldquo;Save all that for good old
Dynamite. He knew it was he or I, and he&mdash;he
took it.&rdquo; There were tears in Kentucky&rsquo;s
eyes&mdash;and the crowd loved him for it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Kentucky,&rdquo; Coach Dizney dropped in beside
the slim boy as the team marched off the
field, &ldquo;you may ride back to Hillcrest in my
car. Your friend, Jensie Crider, rode over with
us.&rdquo; There was a strange, new light of friendliness
in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; Kentucky hesitated, &ldquo;I sort of reckoned
maybe I&rsquo;d ought to see about Dynamite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dynamite is all right,&rdquo; was the coach&rsquo;s reply.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in good hands. He&rsquo;s with Doc
Owslie. He&rsquo;s a fine, dependable doctor. Besides&mdash;&rdquo;
he was tempted to say more but
stopped at this. &ldquo;The other might not be true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Al&mdash;all right,&rdquo; Kentucky agreed. &ldquo;That
will be grand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny Thompson had somehow felt from
the beginning that this was to be a Hillcrest
victory. No one in all the world would have
given so much to watch it from the sidelines.
This had been impossible. There would be, he
knew right well, a grand and glorious celebration
in the old home town after the game. The
team would be back. All their admirers and
all the girls of the school would be there and
all the old grads. Were they to wander from
place to place down town? By no means! The
old Blue Moon was the spot for this jollification.
And he should be prepared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>Having bought out an entire bakery, he had
rented its ovens. Into these ovens on great
dripping pans, he thrust two legs of beef, five
leg o&rsquo; lambs, three hams and a half dozen pork
loins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have hot sandwiches for all,&rdquo; he said
to Aunt Mandy, his colored cook. &ldquo;Hot ones
for all. And you, Aunt Mandy, all I ask of you
is three hundred little turnover pies, all
mince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lands o&rsquo; livin&rsquo;, child,&rdquo; Aunt Mandy exclaimed.
&ldquo;Three hundred!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, son, three hundred comin&rsquo; up.&rdquo;
And three hundred it was.</p>
<p>Ah yes, it was a grand and glorious feast
Johnny prepared. One thing he forgot, the big
room at the Blue Moon could scarcely accommodate
sixty people standing up. And a
mighty horde in trucks, busses, and private
cars, some even on bicycles was pouring toward
the Blue Moon at sunset.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Kentucky,&rdquo; the coach said with a side-wise
glance at the boy as their car glided toward
home, &ldquo;I gave you a chance at being captain
of the team. In that last play, you could have
called for a goal kick. Punch would have sent
it over for that other point. You called for a
line-buck. How come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well you see,&rdquo; there was a tremor in Kentucky&rsquo;s
voice&mdash;he loved the coach and feared
his displeasure more than almost anything in
the world, &ldquo;you see, coach, I overheard you
tell Dynamite he&rsquo;d played great ball this season,
which he had, and that, if he won that
game you&rsquo;d see that he got the ball for himself
for a keepsake. That&mdash;that I thought was
swell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you see, coach,&rdquo; Kentucky was desperately
in earnest now, &ldquo;you see there was a big
crowd heading for the gate, just back of the
goal. If we tried for a goal, we&rsquo;d make it all
right but the ball would go into the crowd and
then&mdash;somebody&rsquo;d plug a hole in that ball, let
out the air and tuck it under his coat. So-o&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you passed up your chance to give
Dynamite a break.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes. That&rsquo;s it. It was all right wasn&rsquo;t
it, coach? Wasn&rsquo;t it now? We&mdash;we didn&rsquo;t
need the point. The game was over and we&mdash;we&rsquo;d
won and everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Kentucky.&rdquo; There was a wide smile of
approval on the coach&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;It was more
than all right. It was sporting! Just grand,
Kentucky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; Kentucky murmured.
Kentucky had been worried about Dynamite
but the instant he climbed from the car he
spotted him. He was standing at the edge of
the gathering crowd. Grinning a broad grin
he said, &ldquo;&rsquo;Lo, Kentucky. Who won the game?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, old Kentuck,&rdquo; he laughed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a ghost. It takes more than a Naperville
man to knock me out for keeps. That fellow
rammed his head up under my chin and
put me to sleep, that&rsquo;s all. When I woke up, I
felt better than ever. I&rsquo;d had a good rest.&rdquo; He
laughed merrily.</p>
<p>When Johnny saw the crowd, he called loudly
for help. The team responded to a man.
They carried two steaming legs of beef, five
leg o&rsquo; lambs, three hundred pies and all the
rest of the feast to the big gym floor. There
everybody feasted to his heart&rsquo;s content.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>Who was to pay the butcher and baker? In
such a jam there was neither time nor opportunity
to collect nickels, dimes, and quarters.
Johnny had been too busy to notice such a
trifling detail. It was not, however, entirely
neglected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; a big burly grad, wearing a tall
paper hat exclaimed, &ldquo;we shall proceed to pass
the basket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seizing one handle of a huge baker&rsquo;s basket,
he invited a pal of other days to join him, and
together they made the rounds. The clink of
silver and the flutter of green paper was heard
and seen in every corner of the broad floor.</p>
<p>At last, hunting up Johnny, they set the
basket before him. The leader said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the compliments of an admiring
throng to the good scout who discovered our
winner, Old Kentucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then such a shout as went up from the
throng. &ldquo;Give and it shall be given unto you,&rdquo;
Johnny thought as he tried in vain to swallow
a lump in his throat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Kentucky, old boy,&rdquo; Johnny said as
they sat by the big glowing stove in the Blue
Moon sometime later, &ldquo;the big war is over. All
you got to do now is study and help me here a
little. All I got to do is to keep making this
place a success. The old Blue Moon,&rdquo; he murmured
these last words softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the slim boy agreed, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all, but
somehow, Johnny, that makes me feel like a
plumb flat tire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Johnny in an impressive tone,
&ldquo;is just the way I feel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did the old Blue Moon and Hillcrest hold
them both? When Johnny sat dreaming of
Panther Eye and his two strange companions
of another world, did he always succeed in dismissing
them from his memory?</p>
<p>Your guess is as good as ours, but if you
really want to know you will have to read that
other book <i>The Seal of Secrecy</i>. What was the
seal and what the secret? Read and see.</p>
